    <h2  id="INTRODUCTORY_ACCOUNT">AN INTRODUCTORY
      ACCOUNT OF THE ORIGIN AND OBJECT OF THE TREATISES &amp; OF
      CELLINI’S POSITION AS CRAFTSMAN AND AUTHOR.</h2>


    <p class="drop-capx">This translation is intended for the
      workshop; &amp; to bring home to English craftsmen, &amp; more
      particularly to my colleagues and pupils at Essex House, the
      methods and practice of the Goldsmith of the Renaissance. It is
      with this end in view that the work has been undertaken, and I
      am in hopes that the knowledge of this may induce my critics to
      give it a kindlier reading, aware as I am of its many
      shortcomings.</p>

    <p>To the translator of the treatises two things are necessary,
      Italian scholarship and a thorough knowledge of workshop
      technicalities; these two qualities are difficult—perhaps
      impossible—to combine, and I am conscious of grave deficiencies
      in both, but more especially in the former.  My endeavour has
      been to follow the lead set me by John Addington Symonds and to
      make this first English translation of the treatises serve, if
      but in some far-off measure, as a continuation volume to his
      masterly translation of the Autobiography. I have in many cases,
      therefore, adopted his manner of handling the subject, but
      inasmuch as the more technical and less directly personal matter
      with which the treatises deal, demands a somewhat different
      treatment, I have sought to retain what I would call the
      workshop vernacular, without at the same time sacrificing the
      archaism of the old Italian dialect.</p>

    <p>Cellini’s graphic touch, which gives their manifold brilliancy
      to the varying passages of that wonderful autobiography, is
      equally evident in the treatises. But this very vividness
      increases the translator’s difficulty. The book is full of
      amusing workshop pictures and anecdotes; but it is always a
      workshop book. Cellini sees each process before him as he
      describes it, we, however, only hear the description, we do not
      see the process, hence it is often to the expert metal worker
      alone that some of the more complex technical narrations appeal,
      while the translator is as frequently in doubt as to whether he
      has realised the picture the author sought to draw.  If, in my
      English rendering of some of these pictures, I have gone astray,
      I trust that my errors may be pointed out by those who are
      better able to follow the author’s meaning.</p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">[x]</span></p>

    <p>Apology is perhaps scarcely necessary for what will often
      appear to be loose or ungrammatical English; this may be an
      offence to the stylist or the pedant, &amp; it certainly at
      first sight jars in what purports to be a scientific text
      book. It would have been perfectly easy for me to cut out the
      improper stories, trim up the phrases and give precision,
      accuracy, and even grammar to certain of the sentences, but this
      would not have been Cellini.  We have him not writing, but
      rapidly &amp; with a delightful forgetfulness and confusion,
      talking his treatises to a scribe, and then omitting to revise
      them; it is the spirit, therefore, of the spoken word, not the
      careful writing, that I have sought to render.</p>

    <p>Another difficulty hampers the translator: the absence of any
      living workshop tradition upon which to fall back when his
      subject becomes too technical. In our day of the subdivision of
      labour the study of the ‘
      <cite>Eight branches of the glorious Art of Goldsmithing</cite>’
      as it was in Benvenuto’s time is a thing of the past. Except in
      a few instances where workshops are conducted with the
      enthusiasm of the artist rather than with the itching fingers of
      the tradesman, there is no such thing as an all round grasp of
      the Art such as Cellini postulates. To the tradesman, the
      sculptor’s ghost, the working jeweller, whether of Birmingham,
      Bond Street, or Clerkenwell, in the thousand and one gimcrack
      shops where they sell ‘merry-thought brooches,’ &amp; ‘our
      latest stock of Christmas presents,’ the glorious Art of
      Goldsmithing has no meaning, or rather is a thing not of eight
      branches but of a hundred subdivisions, fanned into existence by
      a hundred callous machines, and workshop tradition has been
      destroyed by ‘the Trade.’ For the same reason the circle of
      readers will be small. To those of us who in recent years have
      been seeking to lift the art of the goldsmith out of the slough
      of industrial despond, to show once more what the human hand and
      fancy can create, and to relegate, without repudiating it, the
      machine to its right place in relation to human endeavour, all
      this manifold production of rubbishy trinkets, useless
      ornaments, and things made for ‘the Market,’ is stupid and
      wasteful, and makes for the destruction not the ennobling or
      beautifying of life.</p>

    <p>But though small, the circle of my readers will be an earnest
      one. To such as are setting the standard of modern Art and
      Craft, to those who are fighting the trade, and seeking to
      relate the creations of their hands to their reasons for
      existence in life, this book of the aspirations &amp; traditions
      of the old Italian will have some value. Fortunately their
      number is increasing, not only in England, but in Europe &amp;
      in the United States. In the workshops of men like Frampton,
      Alfred Gilbert, Simmons, Fisher, Nelson Dawson; among the
      artists of Glasgow &amp; Birmingham, or among the keener
      creative spirits in New York, whom I have found ready to
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xi">[xi]</span> welcome every
      genuine inspiration of the hand, will the real readers be
      found.</p>

    <p>It is perhaps not my province as a translator to criticise the
      artistic merit of Cellini’s work, but as my hope in placing his
      treatises before English craftsmen is to familiarise them with
      his methods, I may perhaps be allowed to give a few words of
      warning. We must not take Cellini at his own valuation, and we
      must remember that he did not draw that subtle distinction
      between designer and executant that we nowadays are wont to
      do. The fact that every aesthetic criticism is inevitably biased
      by the style of its period must be taken into account by the
      student, if such criticisms as I myself, speaking as an artist,
      should venture to make, are to be of value to him. To Cellini’s
      best-known critics this applies in equal measure. Vasari,
      Delaborde, Milanesi, Brinckman, Symonds, have each had their
      point of view so to speak. To some, like Vasari, it has been
      coloured by what the Germans call ‘die Voll-Renaissance,’ of
      which Cellini in the art of goldsmithing was undoubtedly the
      central figure. To others, like Delaborde, it was influenced by
      the Romantic Reaction of the early Nineteenth Century, and to
      them his work was ‘an exploded myth.’ Criticised from the modern
      point of view—the point of view that distinguishes between
      goldsmith and sculptor, between craftsman &amp; designer—we
      cannot rank him among the highest. There is a want of feeling
      for proportion in such work as we have of his, &amp; the whole
      is marred by the overcrowded detail, often very exquisite in
      itself, of the parts; the craftsman indeed invariably overpowers
      the artist. Above all there is a want of spirituality in all his
      more important work, a want of refinement of soul, if one might
      so term it—a vulgarity. There is none of
      the <ins class="corr" id="greek" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: ευηθεια"><span lang="grc">εὐηθεια</span></ins> of Donatello, the graciousness of
      Ghiberti or Duccio, the mingled strength and sweetness of
      Verocchio, the simple grandeur of Pisanello. Michael Angelo’s
      manner perhaps we can trace, but of his inspiration and his
      self-control there is none.</p>

    <p>If we take Cellini from the point of view he would himself have
      wished us to criticise him, he challenges us first as a sculptor
      &amp; a designer of the figure. In this sphere, however, he
      falls far short of the standard he calls upon us to judge him
      by. Affected &amp; uneven and imperfect in handling is his work
      when set beside that of earlier masters. Attenuated as we see in
      the nymph of Fontainebleau, thick &amp; exaggerated as in the
      Perseus at Florence, leaden and stiff as in the Neptune and
      Cybele of the salt, there is about his figures always
      something <i lang="fr">manqué</i>, they seem indeed to have in
      them the effort of a decaying school.</p>

    <p>Much the same criticism applies to his work as a
      medalist. There is an
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xii">[xii]</span> absence of
      reserve &amp; the fine feeling for his limitations which puts
      him to my mind far beneath Sperandio, Marende, Francia, or other
      of the great Cinquecento medalists, and it needs no artist to
      point to the superiority of the Greek coins with which with
      redoubtable modesty he compares his own.</p>

    <p>To estimate his position as a jeweller is all but impossible,
      as there is not one jewel remaining that can be authenticated as
      his. If, however, we may be allowed to gauge his position as an
      artist from such pieces as are attributed to him in the
      Rothschild, Vienna, Paris, &amp; Chantilly Collections, and of
      which I give some specimens on pages 22 and 24, I should be
      inclined to place him on an equal footing with any of the great
      masters of the early Renaissance or the Middle Ages in any
      country. The reasons of this are not far to seek. Jewellery is,
      before all others, an art of limitations.  An artist cannot but
      put less of himself into a gem than into a statue, he is
      necessarily more cabined. Further, Cellini made most of his
      jewellery as a young man in Florence &amp; Rome, when the
      traditions of the Florentine workshop which reared Brunelleschi,
      Donatello, Ghiberti, were still fresh upon him, &amp; before he
      had as yet attempted the impossible task of translating
      the <i lang="it">gusto grando</i> of Michael Angelo into minor
      craftsmanship. Subject to the disproving of the attributions, I
      give therefore to Cellini as a jeweller an equal place with the
      artists of Greece and Japan, with those of Spain, England and
      Germany in the Middle Ages &amp; the Renaissance, whose works
      are known to us; but as medalist, goldsmith and sculptor, I
      would place him on a much lower footing. My whole criticism
      might be summed up briefly thus: he was a very first-rate
      craftsman, but a very second-rate artist.</p>

    <p>The Autobiography and the Treatises of Cellini must be read
      together, they tail into one another, the former gives the life
      of the man, the second the methods of the craftsman; both alike
      bring out the writer’s strong personality. A few words are
      needed as to their bearing upon one another, and the original of
      the present translation.</p>

    <p>Both the ‘Vita’ &amp; the ‘Trattati’ were dictated by Cellini
      to amanuenses; &amp;, feeling their stylistic imperfections, he
      offered both, after their completion, to literary friends to
      polish and refine before publication. The ‘Vita’ he sent to the
      great historian Benedetto Varchi, who had the good taste and the
      wisdom to leave the MS. as it was, saying that he preferred it
      in its rough &amp; unpolished condition; the latter was placed
      in less tactful hands,<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1"
      class="fnanchor">[1]</a> & Gherardo Spini, a
      literateur<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2"
      class="fnanchor">[2]</a> of the Florentine Academy,
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</span> to whom this
      task has with good reason been attributed, undertook its
      recasting, to the no small detriment of the original. In this
      polished and emasculated form the ‘Trattati’ first appeared
      &amp; for 300 years remained; the Editio
      Princeps<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3"
      class="fnanchor">[3]</a> being published in Florence in the
      shape of a very beautiful volume in 1568, three years before
      Cellini’s death. It was not till 1857 that Carlo Milanesi,
      working on the lines of Francesco Tassi, who had in the Marciana
      re-discovered the original MS., gave to the world the work as
      Cellini had originally dictated it. It is on the ‘Trattati’ of
      the Marcian Codex, therefore, &amp; not of the first edition,
      that this translation is based.</p>

    <p>Cellini is fortunate in having been handled in our own day by
      four eminent and scholarly men, and to the work of each of these
      am I indebted.  Milanesi,<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4"
      class="fnanchor">[4]</a> 1857, may be placed first, and his
      admirable and exhaustive edition of the ‘Trattati’ cannot be too
      highly praised. Herr Justus Brinckman<a id="FNanchor_5"
      href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> followed him, in
      1867, with his excellent translation of the ‘Trattati’ into
      German, and his very able comparative treatment of the work of
      the monk Theophilus<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6"
      class="fnanchor">[6]</a> with that of the Cinquecento artist. In
      1883 Eugène Plon<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7"
      class="fnanchor">[7]</a> brought out his splendid volume on the
      life and works of Cellini, especially valuable for its
      illustrations and the critical investigation of the authentic
      and attributed works of the master. The work of our own John
      Addington Symonds is familiar to most English readers, and it is
      to the study of his masterly translation of the ‘Vita’ that I
      owe my first introduction to Cellini. To his memory I would wish
      here to express my gratefulness, and perhaps the best expression
      of this is in the assurance that through his introduction to
      Cellini has grown up the wish to familiarise the methods of the
      Renaissance workshop among English metal workers, &amp;
      particularly among the metal workers of the Guild of Handicraft
      for whom this book is written.</p>

    <p>My thanks are due to Messrs. Plon &amp; Cie. for their kind
      permission to reproduce the blocks originally used in M. Eugène
      Plon’s volume, and which illustrate in this book the various
      examples as Cellini describes them; and I am indebted to many
      friends, artists &amp; scholars for the most
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</span> part, who have
      helped me with difficulties both in the text and in the
      workshop. To Mr. and Mrs. de Morgan and Captain Victor Ward for
      many hours of helpful, and, I fear, sometimes tedious revision;
      to Miss Constance Blount for her great assistance with the
      enamelling chapter, to Mr. Virtue Tebbs for his advice among the
      coins, to Mr. Wenlock Rollins &amp; Mr. T. Stirling Lee in the
      complicated passages dealing with casting and the making of
      furnaces, and above all to Professor Roberts-Austen and
      Professor Church, not only for their invaluable help on all
      points dealing with metallurgy &amp; stones, but also for their
      kind assistance in correcting the proofs of the whole book. I
      have likewise to thank for their courtesy in allowing me to
      refer to them in one way or another over technical &amp;
      literary difficulties Mr. Heywood Sumner, Mr. M. Hewlett,
      Professor Giglioli of Naples, and Professor Fergusson of
      Glasgow.</p>

    <p class="drop-capx">What first prompted me to write, was the
      knowledge of how fond people are of hearing anything new. Then in
      the second place, &amp; this perhaps had greater weight still, I
      felt much troubled in mind because of all sorts of annoying things
      the which I purpose in the following treatise, with due modesty, to
      recount. That they will move my readers to great pity &amp; no
      little anger in my behalf I am quite positive.  Forsooth you can
      often attribute to difficulties of this kind the most opposite
      turns, to the greatest of evil the greatest of good, and had the
      troubles in question never come upon me, I for sure should never
      have set about writing down these most useful things. Thus it was
      that I did what no one had done before,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
      viz., undertook to write
      about those loveliest secrets and wondrous methods of the great art
      of goldsmithing.  Things such as neither your philosopher, no, nor
      any other kind of man neither, if he be not of the craft, durst
      write about. But since they of the craft are for the most part
      better at work than at talk, they fall into the error of
      silence. This at least I determined to avoid and so set myself
      strenuously to the task. Perhaps never before, or at least so rarely
      that it has never been recorded, has a man been found who was a
      specialist in more than one or at most two of the eight different
      branches of this goodly art, but where he is, he knows, as you may
      imagine, how to make a good thing of them. Mind you, I don’t intend
      to talk about those kinds of muddlers who set themselves busily
      dabbling in all the eight branches at once, and who many and many a
      time are employed by such as either couldn’t or wouldn’t decide
      whether a bit of work was good or whether it was bad. Men of that
      ilk methinks may be likened to the sort of small shopkeeper who
      hangs out in the slums or suburbs of the town and does a little now
      in the bakery line, now in the grocery line, now in the apothecary
      line and now in general retail business—in fact, a little bit of
      everything and nothing good in anything. These sorts of fellows I
      don’t intend to talk about, but only of such as have come to the
      front in what they have done; and only of the right workmanlike way
      of doing things. Well, then, I mind me to begin with, of our city of
      Florence and of how we there were the first to revive all those arts
      that are the sisters of this art of mine; of how the earliest light
      dawned in the time of that first magnificent Cosimo de Medici; of
      how under him flourished Donatello the great sculptor, and Pippo di
      Ser Brunelleschi the great architect, and of that wondrous
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[2]</span> Lorenzo Ghiberti, in
      whose time were made the beautiful gates for what was once the
      ancient temple of Mars and is now the baptistry of our patron
      St. John.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Lorenzo Ghiberti.</i> He was a goldsmith indeed! Not
      only in the wonderfulness of his own peculiar style, but because of
      his unwearied power of marvellous finish, and his exceeding
      diligence in execution. This man, who must be counted among the most
      admirable of goldsmiths, applied himself to everything, but
      especially to the casting of smaller work. And though now and then
      he set about doing large pieces, yet one can see that his particular
      line was the production of small work, and in this branch we may
      well call him a master in the art of casting. Indeed he pursued this
      with such excellence that as is still obvious to all, no man can
      touch him.</p>

    <p><i>Antonio Pollajuolo, or the poulterer’s son</i>, as he is always
      called, was likewise a goldsmith, and a draughtsman too of such
      skill, that not only did all the goldsmiths make use of his
      excellent designs, but the sculptors and painters of the first rank
      also, and gained honour by them, what was more! This man did little
      else beside his admirable drawing, but at this he was always
      busy.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Maso Finiguerra</i> pursued only the art of engraving
      niello, in which craft he had no rival, and he too always made use
      of the designs of the aforesaid Antonio.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Amerigo</i> wrought in the art of enamel, &amp; was by
      far away the first craftsman in it either before or after his
      time. He too, great as he was, made use of the designs of Antonio
      del Pollajuolo.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Michaelangelo</i>, the goldsmith of Pinzidimonte, was
      a capital fellow, and worked in a variety of divers things, and
      especially in the setting of gems.  He wrought and designed well in
      niello, in enamel, in hammered work, and though he come not up to
      the other distinguished men just named, he deserves much praise. He
      was the father of Baccino<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9"
      class="fnanchor">[9]</a> whom Pope Clement made a Knight of
      St. John. He added the surname Bandinelli on his own account, and
      since he had neither family nor arms really, he took the sign of his
      knighthood for a coat. About this man I shall have more than enough
      to tell as we go along.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Bastiano del Bernardetto Cennini</i> was a goldsmith
      and worked also in a number of different things. His forefathers and
      he for many years made the dies for the coins of Florence, until the
      time that Alexander de Medici, the nephew of Pope Clement, became
      Duke. This Bastiano in his youth did admirable large metal
      ware—grosserie<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10"
      class="fnanchor">[10]</a> and hammered
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">[3]</span>
      work,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11"
              class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and verily he was a first-rate
      craftsman. And though I said above I wasn’t going to talk about
      bunglers who take up a number of different things indifferently, one
      must none the less distinguish between those who <em>are</em>
      bunglers &amp; those who are good craftsmen and worthy of
      praise.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Piero</i>, <i lang="it">Giovanni</i>,
      and <i lang="it">Romolo</i>, were brothers, the sons of
      one <i lang="it">Goro Tavolaccino</i>; they were goldsmiths too,
      they did good work and made good designs. Amongst other things they
      were very good at setting jewels in pendants, rings and so forth,
      and this they managed so tastefully that at that time, 1518, they
      had no equal. They also worked in intaglio, in bas-relief, and were
      not bad at hammered work.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Stefano Salteregli</i> was a goldsmith too, a good man
      in his day, working like the others in a number of different things,
      but he died young.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Zanobi</i>, son of <i lang="it">Meo del Lavacchio</i>,
      whose craft he followed, was a goldsmith also, had a charming way of
      working and designed admirably; but he died just when his beard
      began to bloom, at about the age of 20.</p>

    <p>Indeed at that time there were many young fellows, whose equal and
      colleague I was, who promised great things to begin with; but the
      most of them has death snatched away, and the rest have either not
      stuck to the drudgery, or with undeveloped talents have got no
      further. As for me, I have heard myself blamed because I have talked
      so much about such excellent men in one profession only; but I have
      still to tell of work in filigree, an art though the least beautiful
      of many beautiful arts, still very beautiful for all that.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Piero di Nino</i> was a goldsmith, who worked only in
      filigree, an art which, while it affords great charm, is not without
      its difficulties. He, however, knew how to work in it better than
      anyone else. Inasmuch as there was great riches in those days within
      the town, so was it likewise in the country, especially among the
      peasant folk of the plain, who used to get made for their wives a
      sort of velvet girdle with buckle and pin, about half a cubit long
      and covered all over with little spangles. These buckles and pins
      were all wrought in filigree with great delicacy and fashioned in
      silver of excellent setting. When later on I shall show how these
      things are made, I am sure the reader will find delight in them. I
      knew this Piero de Nino when an old man of near 90 years. He died
      partly from fear of dying of hunger, and partly from a shock he got
      one night. As for the dying of hunger it was this way: An edict had
      been issued in the city that no more belts should be worn either by
      peasants or others; and the poor old fellow, who knew no other
      branch of goldsmithing but this, was always grieving, and cursing
      from the bottom of his heart all
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span> those who had a hand in
      making this law. He lived near a draper’s shop, where was a young
      rogue of an urchin, the son of one of them that had made the
      law. The boy, hearing him thus continually cursing his father, ‘Oh,
      Piero,’ said he, ‘if you go on swearing like that, some fine day the
      devil will come and carry you off, bones and all!’ Now one Saturday
      night, when the old chap had worked right up to midnight to finish
      some job he was engaged on that was to go to Bologna, the urchin
      took it into his head to play him a practical joke and give him a
      fright. So he stood on the watch for the old man on his way
      home. The latter, as was his wont, locked up his shop, took his
      lantern in his hand, and, with the lappet of his cloak thrown over
      his head, trudged along ever so slowly, and as lonely as a ghost,
      home to his house, which stood in the via Mozza.  Just as he was
      turning the corner of the old market the urchin, who was awaiting in
      ambush for him, and had tricked himself out with rag-tag, sulphur
      lights, blue fire, and such-like horrible devilries, suddenly jumped
      out upon him. The poor old thing was so terrified at the fearful
      monster thus suddenly coming at him, that he lost his senses; so
      much so that the boy, seeing he had played the fool, had to lead the
      old man home as well as he could, and consign him to the care of his
      grandsons, among whom was one called Meino, a courier, who
      afterwards became warden of Arezzo. Suffice it, the fright had been
      so great, that soon after the poor old fellow died. This is usually
      stated as the actual cause of Piero’s death, and I have myself
      ofttimes heard it narrated.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Antonio di Salvi</i> was another of our Florentine
      goldsmiths, a capital grosserie worker. He died at a very great
      age.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Salvatore Pilli</i> likewise was a first-rate man, who
      also died very old; but he never worked in a shop of his own, but
      always in someone else’s.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Solvatore Guasconti</i> was an all round man, more
      especially good in small things. His work in niello and enamel is
      well worthy of praise.</p>

    <p>You must know too that there were ever so many others, all of them
      fellow Florentines, who commenced in the goldsmith’s art and took
      their inspiration from it for various other arts, such as sculpture,
      architecture, and other notable lines of work.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Donatello</i>, for instance, the greatest sculptor
      that ever lived, about whom I shall have plenty to say later on,
      stuck to the goldsmith’s art right along into manhood.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Pippo di ser Brunellesco</i>, the first who gave new
      vigour to the glory of architecture, he too was a goldsmith for a
      long time.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Lorenzo <ins class="corr" id="della" 
      title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: dalla">della</ins> Golpaia</i> also was a goldsmith, and
      always continued true to the art. As for him, he was a very prodigy
      of nature, for he specialised in clock making, and finding his own
      peculiar bent in this line, so wonderfully reproduced the secret of
      the heavens and the stars that
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span> you really might have
      thought he lived up in the sky! Amongst other things he showed his
      cunning in a clock he made for the magnificent Lorenzo de Medici. In
      this clock he put the Medici arms, making them represent the seven
      planets; these used to move round slowly, and revolve just like the
      planets in the sky do. This clock is still in its place, but it is
      not what it used to be because it has been so badly taken care
      of.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Andrea del Verocchio</i>, the sculptor, remained a
      goldsmith up to the time of manhood. He was the master of Lionardo
      da Vinci, painter, sculptor, architect, philosopher, musician;—a
      veritable angel incarnate of whom I shall have heaps to tell
      whenever he comes to mind.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Desiderio</i>, too, was a goldsmith in his youth, who
      took to sculpture later, and was a great master in the art.</p>

    <p>I can’t possibly recount all our Florentines who were adepts in the
      great goldsmiths’ art, suffice it that I have mentioned most of
      those who became famous therein. But I will say a word or two about
      some of the foreigners who seem to me pre-eminent, and I will begin
      with such as wrought in niello.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Martino</i><a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12"
      class="fnanchor">[12]</a> was a goldsmith from beyond the Alps,
      who came from some German town or other. He was a first-rate
      fellow in designing, &amp; in intaglio work in the way they do
      it there. It was just about the time when the fame of our Maso
      Finiguerra spread abroad, who did those wonderful niello
      intaglios,—by the way, you may still see preserved in our lovely
      Church of St. John of Florence a silver pyx of his, with a
      crucifix above it, &amp; the two malefactors, with a lot of
      detail of horses and other things.  Antonio del Pollajuolo, whom
      I mentioned before, did the design, and Maso the niello
      work.</p>

    <p>Well, then, this good German Martino set to with great diligence
      and zeal to practise the art of niello, and turned out a number of
      excellent things. But because he saw that he could not produce work
      that should come up to our Finiguerra’s for beauty and go, yet being
      a right-minded man, and wishing to do something that should be
      generally useful, he set to cutting his intaglios on copper plates
      with the graver (<i lang="it">bulino</i>) for so is the little steel
      tool called with which you engrave. In this wise he engraved a
      number of pretty little picture-tales, very well composed, and with
      great understanding of light &amp; shade, in fact as far as one can
      say such a thing of a piece of German work, they were charming.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Alberto Duro</i> also tried his hand at engraving, and
      with much greater success than Martino. He too was not satisfied
      with the results of his
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span> work in niello, and so
      determined to do engravings, and this he did so well that no one can
      hold a candle to him. He too was a goldsmith, nor was he satisfied
      with niello only, he resorted in addition to his engraving, and did
      extraordinarily well in that line.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Andrea Mantegni</i>, our great Italian painter, tried
      it too, but couldn’t do it, so the less said about it the
      better.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Antonio Pollajuolo</i>, the same happened with him,
      and because both these men could make nothing of it, I’ll say naught
      but that Mantegni was an excellent painter, and Pollajuolo an
      excellent draughtsman.</p>

    <p><i lang="it">Antonio da Bologna</i><a id="FNanchor_13"
      href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>
      &amp; <i lang="it">Marco da Ravenna</i> must also be counted
      among the goldsmiths. Antonio was the first who began to engrave
      in the manner of Alberto Duro. He studied closely the work of
      the great painter Raphael of Urbino. He engraved beautifully,
      could design in the right good Italian manner, and studied
      closely the style and methods of those old Greeks, who always
      know how to do things better than other folk. Many others
      pursued this branch of engraving, but because none of them came
      up to the great Alberto Duro, &amp; even also a long way behind
      our Italian Antonio of Bologna, I’ll not mention them; more
      especially as to do so would be to go beyond the limits of our
      inquiry, which is to consider the lovely art of niello and all
      its many difficulties.</p>

    <p>Now you must know that when I first was a goldsmith’s apprentice in
      the 15th year of the century, which was my 15th year too, the art of
      engraving in niello had quite fallen into disuse. It was only
      because a few old men still living did nothing else but talk of the
      beauty of the art and of the great masters who had wrought in it,
      &amp; above all of Finiguerra, that I was seized with a mighty
      desire to learn it; so I set to diligently to master it, &amp; with
      the examples of Finiguerra before me, made many good pieces.</p>

    <p>My difficulty, however, was how to find out after I had engraved
      the intaglio how the niello that was to fill it ought to be made. So
      I went on trying ever so hard until I not only mastered the
      difficulties of making the material, but the whole art became a mere
      child’s play to me. Here, then, is the way in which niello work is
      done.</p>

        I. ON THE ART OF NIELLO.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">Take an ounce of the finest silver, two ounces of
      copper well purified, and three ounces of lead as pure as you can
      possibly get it.  Then take a little goldsmiths’ crucible
      sufficiently big to melt the three in together. You must first take
      the one ounce of silver &amp; the two ounces of copper and put the
      two together in the crucible, and the crucible in a goldsmiths’
      blast-furnace, and when the silver and the copper are molten &amp;
      well mixed together, add the lead to them. Then quickly draw the
      crucible out, and with a bit of charcoal held in your tongs, stir it
      round till it is well mixed. The lead, according to its wont, will
      make a little scum, so with your charcoal try and take this off as
      much as possible, until the three metals are fully &amp; cleanly
      blended. At the same time have ready a little earthenware flask
      about as big as your fist, the neck of which should, however, not be
      wider than might hold one of your fingers. Fill this flask about
      half full with very finely ground sulphur, &amp; empty into this
      your molten mass, while quite fluid &amp; hot. Then quickly stuff it
      up with moist earth, and holding it in your hand wrapped up in a
      stout bit of canvas, say for instance an old sack, shake it to &amp;
      fro while it is cooling. As soon as it is cold, break the flask and
      take out the stuff, and you will see that by virtue of the sulphur
      it will have got the black colour you want. But mind you take care
      that the sulphur is the blackest you can get.<a id="FNanchor_14"
      href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> As for the flask, you
      may take one of those which are generally used for separating gold
      from silver. Take then your niello, which will now be in a number of
      little grains,—for you must know that the object of all this shaking
      up and down whilst cooling in the sulphur is to make it
      combine,—&amp; put it anew into a crucible, then melt it in a
      moderate fire, adding to it a grain of borax. When you have recast
      it two or three times, and after each casting broken up your niello,
      take it out, for you will see it will now be splendidly broken
      up,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a>
      and that is as it ought to be,—and that will do.</p>

    <p>Now I’ll show you how to apply and make up your niello; but first a
      word or two about the plate on which your intaglio is to be
      engraved, whether in silver or in gold, for niello is used only on
      these metals. If you want to get the plate on which you have cut
      your work nice and smooth &amp; without holes,<a id="FNanchor_16"
      href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> you must boil it in a
      solution of clean water
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span> mixed with a deal of
      very clean charcoal, the best for this purpose being charred
      oak. When your work has cooked in the pot for about a quarter of an
      hour or so, transfer it to a beaker of clean fresh water, and scrub
      it for a long time with a clean brush till every particle of dirt be
      rubbed off it. Then see that you have ready a bit of iron long
      enough to hold the work to the fire: its length should be about
      three or four palms, more or less in accordance with what the nature
      of your work may seem to you to need. But mind you look out that the
      iron to which your work is fixed be neither too thick nor too thin;
      for it should be of such sort that when you put both to the fire
      they should heat equally; for if either the iron or the plate become
      heated first, you’ll make a mess of it, so pay great attention to
      this. Next take your niello, &amp; crush it on an anvil, or on a
      porphyry stone, &amp; do this with a pair of pliers or a copper rod,
      and so that it does not spring aside. Take care, too, that it is
      crushed to grains and not to a powder, &amp; these grains should be
      as equal as possible, and about the size of a grain of millet or
      sago, if not less. After this put the niello grains into some sort
      of vase or glass bottle, and with fresh clean water wash it out well
      till it be quite purified from any dust or dirt that may have got
      into it during the pounding. This done, take a spatula of brass or
      copper, and spread the niello evenly over your engraved plate to
      about the thickness of the back of a table-knife. Then powder over
      it a little well-ground borax, but mind it be not too much. Put a
      few pieces of wood or charcoal so that you can blow them into flame
      with your bellows, and this done, put your work very slowly to the
      wood fire &amp; subject it to the heat very dexterously till you see
      the niello beginning to melt. But look out that, when it does begin
      to melt, you don’t get it too hot, or into a red heat, for if it
      gets too hot, it will lose its natural character and become soft,
      because, the principal component of niello being lead, this lead
      will begin to corrode the silver, or even the gold of which your
      work is made; in this way you might have all your pains for nothing.
      Have great heed to this, therefore, which is as important as your
      good engraving to begin with.</p>

    <p>Now before we follow the work through to the end, we will pause and
      consider things a bit. I advise you when you are holding your work
      over the fire and see the niello begin to disintegrate, to have at
      hand a fairly stout iron rod, with a flatted end: this end hold in
      the fire, and when the niello begins to run, rapidly put your hot
      iron over it, and, treating it as if it were wax, spread it well,
      until it has quite filled all the graven part of your
      intaglio. After this, when your work has got cold, take a delicate
      file, and file off your niello, &amp; after you have removed a
      certain quantity, not so as to graze your intaglio, but sufficient
      to lay it bare, take your work and put it on the hot ashes or the
      live charcoal.</p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span></p>

    <p>When it is a little hotter than the hand can bear, or even a bit
      hotter still, but before it gets too hot, take your steel burnisher,
      well-tempered, &amp; with a little oil burnish your niello as firmly
      as the work would seem to admit of, and with due discretion in every
      case. The only object of this burnishing, is to stop up certain
      bubble holes<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17"
      class="fnanchor">[17]</a> that sometimes come during the
      process. You’ve only got to have patience enough, and with a little
      practice you’ll find this burnishing stops all the holes up
      beautifully.</p>

    <p>After this, take your knife &amp; touch up the intaglio. Then to
      finish with take some Tripoli powder and pounded charcoal, &amp;
      with a reed peeled down to the pith, scrub your work till it is
      smooth and beautiful.</p>

    <p>Oh thou discreetest of readers, marvel not that I have given so
      much time in writing about all this, but know that I have not even
      said half of what is needed in this same art, the which in very
      truth would engage a man’s whole energies, and make him practise no
      other art at all.  In my youth from my 15th to my 18th year I
      wrought a good deal at this art of niello, always from my own
      designs, and was much praised for my work.</p>

      <h3 id="CHAPTER_II_ON_FILIGREE">CHAPTER II. ON
        FILIGREE WORK.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">Though I don’t work much in filigree myself, I
      have none the less done one or two very difficult and very beautiful
      pieces of work in this line, and so I’ll say something about it. The
      art is a charming one, and when well executed &amp; well understood
      is as pleasing to the eye of man as anything done in
      goldsmithing. Those who did the best work in filigree were the men
      who had a good grip of drawing, especially designing from foliage
      &amp; pierced spray work, for everything that you set to work upon
      requires first of all that you think it out as a design. And though
      many have practised the art without making drawings first because
      the material in which they worked was so easily handled and so
      pliable; still, those who made their drawings first did the best
      work. Now give ear to the way the art is pursued.</p>

    <p>Innumerable are the purposes to which you may apply filigree. So
      first of all we will begin with some of the ordinary every-day
      things &amp; then have a look at such other things as will make a
      man’s mouth water. The more ordinary use to which filigree is
      applied, is for buckles and pins for belts, such as I told of in the
      introductory chapter of my book. Then is it used, too, for making
      crosses &amp; earrings, small caskets, buttons, certain kinds of
      little charms and divers manner of necklaces; these latter are often
      worn with fillings of musk, as is also frequently the case with
      bracelets; &amp; so an endless other variety of things. Now it is
      necessary that for everything that you want to execute in this line
      of work, you must to begin with make a gold or silver plate exactly
      in the way you want your work ultimately to be. After this is done,
      and of course, after you have made your drawing, have ready all the
      different kinds of wire of which you will have need, such for
      instance as thick and thin &amp; middling, the usual three sizes, in
      due sequence, and perhaps a fourth size likewise. Then have ready
      some ‘<i lang="it">granaglia</i>’—granulated metal—for so the stuff
      is called; and in order to make this, you take your gold or silver,
      melt it, and when it is well melted, pour it into a pot of powdered
      charcoal.  In this way every kind of granulated metal is
      made.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18"
      class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Then, too, you must have your solder
      prepared and ready to hand, and the right solder
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span> to use is the
      ‘<i lang="it">terzo</i>’ solder, so called because you make it with
      two ounces of silver and one of copper. Now though many are
      accustomed to make solder with brass, be advised that it is much
      better to make it with copper, and less risky. Take heed that you
      file your solder very fine, then put to every three parts of solder
      one of well ground borax, and, having well mixed them, put them in a
      borax crucible<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19"
      class="fnanchor">[19]</a> such as a goldsmith uses.  Then have handy
      some gum tragacanth,<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20"
      class="fnanchor">[20]</a> a sort of gum which you can buy at any
      apothecary’s. Dissolve this gum tragacanth in a little cup or vase,
      or whatever is convenient. When you have all these things in order,
      you will also need by you two pairs of stout little pliers, and also
      a small sharp chisel cut angularly,<a id="FNanchor_21"
      href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> like the
      wood-engravers use; but its handle ought to be short, the length
      &amp; size of the handle of a graver. For its object is to cut the
      wires in accordance as you may wish to twist them either one way or
      the other, as your design requires, or your taste determines.  You
      will also need a copper plate fairly stout, very smooth, and about
      the size of the palm of your hand. When you have twisted your wire
      into the shapes you want, you must place it bit by bit on the copper
      plate, and so bit by bit with a camel’s-hair brush streak it over
      with the solution of gum tragacanth, arranging at the same time the
      little gold &amp; silver beads tastily. During the time that you are
      piecing together your bits of leaves and other particles, the
      tragacanth water will hold them together sufficiently to prevent
      their moving. Then every time that you have composed a part of your
      spray-work, and before the tragacanth water has got dry, throw a
      little soldering powder out of your borax upon it, and put just as
      much as may suffice to solder your spray work, &amp; not more. The
      object of putting just enough on, is that the work when soldered
      shall be graceful and slender, for too much solder makes it look
      fat.</p>

    <p>Hereupon, when it is time for soldering, you will need in readiness
      a little stove, such as is used for enamelling, but since there is a
      great difference between the melting of enamel &amp; the soldering
      of filigree, you will need to heat this furnace with a much smaller
      fire. Then attach your work to a little iron plate, but so that the
      work stands free above it, and put it little by little to the heat
      of the furnace, until the borax shall have fumed away, &amp; done as
      is its wont. Now too much heat would move the wires you have woven
      out of place, so it is essential to take the greatest possible
      care,—really it’s quite impossible to tell it properly in writing: I
      could explain it all right enough by word of mouth, or better still
      show you how it’s done—still, come along—we’ll try and go on as we
      started!</p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>

    <p>When you are ready to begin soldering, and want to make your solder
      flow, put your work in the furnace, &amp; place beneath it a few
      little pieces of well-dried wood, fanning them up a bit with your
      bellows. Then it is not a bad thing, too, after this to throw a few
      coarse cinders upon the fire, &amp; this done at the right moment
      does a deal of good. But it is practice and experience, together
      with a man’s own discretion, that are the only real ways of teaching
      one how to bring about good results in this or in anything. When
      your work is soldered, that is to say if it be silver-work, you must
      to begin with, cook it in tartar<a id="FNanchor_22"
      href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> mixed with some salt
      or other, and cook it so long till all the borax is off it. This
      ought to last about a quarter of an hour, by which time it will be
      quite clean, &amp; free from borax. If on the other hand it be made
      of gold, you must put it in strong vinegar for about 24 hours, until
      you see a little salt forming upon it. And so, after this manner can
      you fashion all sorts of rosettes that may be needed in your work,
      such as I have not only seen, but myself made, and that give much
      variety to the work, when you have ordered them each in their place,
      and in accordance with your design.</p>

    <p>But now I’ll tell you yet something further about the cunning of
      this charming art; I’ll tell you of a wonderful and priceless work
      that was shown me in France, in Paris, their most beautiful &amp;
      richest city—which the French, according to their language, call
      ‘Paris simpari,’ that is to say ‘sans peer,’ or without equal. It
      was in the service of King Francis in the year 1541. This most royal
      and splendid of Kings retained me in Paris, and gave me of his
      liberality a castle, standing in the city itself, and called by the
      name of the ‘little Nello.’ Here I worked for four years, the which
      will be recounted all in its place when I come to tell of the great
      works which I made for this most worthy King. Here I will continue
      my talk as to the way of working in filigree, and as I promised,
      tell of a work most rare—a work such as may perchance never again be
      executed—which I saw in this city. One day—a solemn fête day—the
      King went at Vespers to his ‘Sainte Chapelle’ in Paris. He sent word
      to me that I was to be at Vespers too, as he had something nice to
      show me. When Vespers were over the King called me to him through
      the Constable, who sometimes represents the King himself. This
      gentleman came, took me by the hand, &amp; led me before the King,
      who with great kindness and affability began to show me the most
      beautiful trinkets and jewels, and briefly asked me my opinion on
      them. After these he showed me a variety of ancient camei about as
      big as the palm of a large hand, and asked me many things about
      them, on which I gave him my opinion. They had stood me in the
      middle of all of them;—there
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span> was the King, and the
      King of Navarre his brother-in-law, and the Queen of Navarre, and
      all the first flower of the nobility, &amp; of those that came
      nearest to the crown; &amp; before all of them his Majesty showed me
      many beautiful &amp; priceless things, about which we talked for a
      long time to his great delight. Thereupon he showed me a drinking
      bowl without a foot &amp; of a middling size, wrought in filigree
      with the choicest spray-work, upon which much other ornamental
      detail was admirably applied. Now list to my description of it! In
      among the spray-work and interstices of filigree were settings of
      the most beautiful enamel of various colours; and when you held it
      to the light these enamel fillings almost looked as if they were
      transparent—indeed it seemed impossible that such a piece of work
      should ever have been made. Thus at least thought the King, &amp;
      asked me very pleasantly, since I had thus highly praised the bowl,
      could I possibly imagine how the work was done. I thereupon answered
      his question thus: ‘Sacred Majesty,’ quoth I, ‘I can tell you
      exactly how it is done, even so much so that you, being the man of
      rare ability that you are, shall know how just as well as the master
      himself that made it, knew, but the explanation of the methods that
      underlie its making will take rather a long time.’ At these words of
      mine all the noble assembly that waited on his Majesty thronged
      around me, the King declared he had never seen work of so wondrous a
      kind, and since it was so easy of explanation, bade me tell as I had
      promised. Then spake I: ‘If you want to make a bowl like this, you
      must begin by making one of thin sheet iron, about the thickness of
      a knife back larger than the one you want ultimately to produce in
      filigree. Then with a brush you paint it inside with a solution of
      fine clay, cloth shearings &amp; Tripoli clay<a id="FNanchor_23"
      href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> finely ground; then
      you take finely drawn gold wire of such a thickness as your
      wise-minded master may wish that of his bowl to be.  This thread
      should be so thick that if you beat it out flat with a hammer on
      your clean little cup, it bends more readily in the width than
      otherwise, in such a way that it may then be flattened out to a
      ribbon shape, two knife-blades broad, &amp; as thin as a sheet of
      paper. You must be careful to stretch your thread out very evenly,
      &amp; have it tempered soft, because it will then be easier to twist
      with your pliers. Then with your fine design before you, you
      commence to compose your stretched thread inside the iron bowl,
      first the principal members, according to their way of arrangement,
      piece by piece painting them over with solution of gum tragacanth,
      so that they adhere to the clay-solution with which you pasted the
      inside. Then when your craftsman has set all his principal members
      and larger outlines, he must put in the spray work, each piece in
      its place, just as the design guides him, setting it spray by spray,
      bit by bit in the
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span> way I have told
      you. And then when all this is in proper order, he must have ready
      his enamels of all colours, well ground and well washed. It is true
      you might do the soldering first before you put in the enamel, &amp;
      you would do it in the way that I explained above when I considered
      the soldering of filigree work, but it’s as good one way as the
      other, soldered or not soldered. And when all the preliminary work
      is carefully done, and all the interstices nicely filled with the
      coloured enamels, you put the whole thing in the furnace, in order
      to make the enamel flow.  To begin with you must only subject it to
      a slight heat, after which, when you have filled up any little
      openings with a second coat of enamel you may put it in again under
      a rather bigger fire, &amp; if it appear after this that there are
      still crannies to be filled up, you put it to as strong a fire as
      the craft allows and as your enamels will bear. When all this is
      done you remove it from the iron bowl, which will be easy by reason
      of the paste of clay to which the actual work and the enamels are
      attached.  Then with a particular kind of stones called
      “<i lang="it">frasinelle</i>,” and with fresh water you begin the
      process of smoothing it down, and you must go on with this so long
      till the enamel is polished down to an equal thickness throughout
      and as may seem good to you. And when you have got as far as the
      “<i lang="it">frasinelle</i>” can take you, you may continue your
      polishing with still finer stones, and lastly with a piece of reed
      and tripoli clay (as I explained it in niello work), then the
      surface of your enamel will be very smooth and beautiful.’ When the
      admirable King Francis heard all this description of mine, he
      declared that they who knew so well how to explain, doubtless knew
      still better how to perform, &amp; that I had so well pointed out to
      him the whole process of a work that he had erst thought impossible,
      that now, owing to my description, he really thought he could do it
      himself. And therewith he heaped great favours upon me, such as you
      can’t possibly imagine.</p>

      <h3 id="CHAPTER_III_CONCERNING">CHAPTER
        III. CONCERNING THE ART OF ENAMELLING.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">Now let us have a talk about the beautiful art of
      enamelling, and therewith consider those excellent craftsmen who
      wrought best therein; and with the knowledge of their lovely
      creations before us see what is beautiful and what is difficult in
      this art, and get to understand the difference between what is
      really good and what is indifferent. As I said in the first chapter
      of my book, this art was well practised in Florence, and I think too
      that in all those countries where they used it, and pre-eminently
      the French and the Flemings, and certainly those who practised it in
      the proper manner, got it originally from us Florentines. And
      because they knew how difficult the real way was, &amp; that they
      would never be able to get to it, they set about devising another
      way that was less difficult. In this they made such progress, that
      they soon got according to popular opinion the name of good
      enamellers.  It is certainly true that if a man only works at a
      thing long enough, all his practising makes his hand very sure in
      his art: &amp; that was the way with the folk who lived beyond the
      Alps.</p>

    <p>As for the right and proper way about which I intend to talk, it is
      done in this wise. First you make a plate either of gold or silver
      &amp; of the size and shape that your work is to be. Then you
      prepare a composition of ‘<i lang="it">pece
        greca</i>,’<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24"
      class="fnanchor">[24]</a> and brick ground very fine, and a little
      wax; according to the season; as for the latter you must add rather
      more in cold than in hot weather. This composition you put upon a
      board great or small in accordance with the size of your work, &amp;
      on this you put your plate when you have heated it. Then you draw an
      outline with your compasses in depth rather less than a knife back,
      and, this done, ground your plate anywhere within this outline and
      with the aid of a four-cornered chisel to the depth which the enamel
      is to be, and this you must do very carefully.  After this you can
      grave in intaglio on your plate anything that your heart delights
      in, figure, animals, legend with many figures, or anything else you
      like to cut with your graver and your chisels, and with all the
      cleanness that you possibly can. A bas-relief has to be made about
      the depth of two ordinary sheets of paper, and this bas-relief has
      to be sharply cut with finely-pointed steel tools, especially in the
      outlines, and if your figures are clothed with drapery, know that
      these folds, if sharply drawn and well projecting, will well express
      the drapery. It is all a question
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">[16]</span> of how deeply your
      work is engraved, and the little folds &amp; flowerets that you
      figure on the larger folds may go to represent damask. The more care
      you put into this part of your work, the less liable your enamel
      will be to crack &amp; peel off hereafter, and the more carefully
      you execute the intaglio the more beautiful your work will be in the
      end. But don’t imagine that by touching up the surface of your work
      with punches and hammer, it will gain anything in the relief, for
      the enamels will either not stick at all, or the surface that you
      are enamelling will still appear rough. And just as when a man cuts
      an intaglio he often rubs it with a little charcoal, such as willow
      or walnut wood, which he rubs on with a little saliva or water, the
      same you may do here when you cut your intaglio in order to see it
      stand out better, because the shine made by the metal tools on the
      plate will make it difficult for you to see your work.  But, as
      owing to this the work gets a bit untidy and greasy, it is
      necessary, when you have finished it, to boil it out in a concoction
      of ashes<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25"
      class="fnanchor">[25]</a> such as was described above for niello
      work.</p>

    <p>Now let us say you want to begin enamelling your work, and that it
      is in gold. I propose telling you first of how to enamel on gold,
      and then how to do it on silver. For both gold and silver the same
      cleanness is necessary, and in either case the same method, but
      there is a little difference in applying the enamel and also in the
      actual enamels applied, for the red enamel cannot be put on silver
      because the silver does not take it. The reasons of this I would
      explain, were it not too long a business, so I’ll say nothing about
      it, especially as to do so would take us beyond the scope of our
      inquiry. Furthermore I have no intention of talking about how
      enamels are made, because that in itself is a great art, also
      practised by the ancients, &amp; discovered by wise men, but as far
      as we are aware the ancients did not know of the transparent red
      enamel, which it is said, was discovered by an alchemist who was a
      goldsmith as well.  But all I need tell of it is that this
      alchemist, while engaged in the search of how to make gold, had
      mixed together a certain composition, and when his work was done,
      there appeared among the stuff in the metal rest of his crucible a
      sediment of the loveliest red glass, just as we see it to this
      day. After much time and trouble, &amp; by many mixings of it with
      other enamels the goldsmith finally discovered the process of making
      it.  This enamel is far the most beautiful of all, and is termed in
      the goldsmiths’ art ‘<i lang="it">smalto roggio</i>,’ red enamel, or
      in French ‘<i lang="it">rogia chlero</i>’ (rouge claire) that is to
      say, and which means in other words, red and clear or transparent. A
      further sort of red enamel we have also, which is not transparent
      and has not the splendid colour, and this is used on silver because
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span> that metal will not
      take the other. And though I have not had much practical experience
      of it, I have tried it often enough to be able to talk about it. As
      for the other, it lends itself more aptly to gold by reason of its
      being produced from the minerals and compositions that have been
      used in the search how to make gold. Now let us return to the
      process of enamelling.</p>

    <p>The method of enamelling is much the same as painting, for you can
      have as many colours as come within human ken. And just as in
      painting so in enamelling you have them all ranged in order and all
      well ground to begin with. We have a proverb in the craft which
      says: ‘<i lang="it">Smalto sottilé e niello grosse</i>.’ ‘Enamel
      should be fine, niello should be coarse,’ and that’s just what it
      is. You put your enamel in a little round mortar of well-hardened
      steel, and about the size of your palm, &amp; then you pound it up
      with very clean water and with a little steel pestle specially made
      for the purpose of the necessary size. Some, to be sure, have
      pounded their enamels on porphyry or serpentine stone, which are
      very hard, &amp; moreover have done this dry, but I now think that
      the steel mortar is much better because you can pound it so much
      cleaner. The reasons of this we may consider later, but because we
      want here to be as brief as possible &amp; to avoid any unnecessary
      difficulties and useless confusion, all we need know is that the
      particular mortars in question are made in Milan.  Many excellent
      men of this craft came from Milan and its adjacent territory, and I
      knew one of the best of them. His nick-name was Master
      Caradosso,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26"
      class="fnanchor">[26]</a> and he never wanted to be called by any
      other, and this nick-name was given him once by a Spaniard who was
      in a great rage because he was kept waiting by the Master for a
      piece of work which he had promised to get finished by a particular
      day. When the Spaniard saw that he could not have it in time, he got
      so fearfully angry that he looked as if he would like to do him an
      injury, at which Caradosso to appease his wrath, began excusing
      himself as best he could, and in such a plaintive tone of voice, and
      such an uncouth Milanese lingo, that the irate nobleman burst out
      laughing, and looking him straight in the face, cried out in his
      high &amp; mighty manner: ‘<i lang="it">Hai cara d’osso</i>,’ that
      is to say, ‘You bum face.’ The sound of this appellation pleased
      Caradosso so much that he never would answer to any other. When
      later on one fine day he found out what it really meant, he would
      gladly have got rid of it, but he couldn’t, it was too late. I knew
      him as an old man of 80 in Rome, where he was never called by any
      other name than Caradosso. He was a splendid goldsmith, especially
      at enamelling, and I shall have more to say of him later on.</p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span></p>

    <p>Now let us proceed with the beautiful art of enamelling. As I said
      above the best way of pounding the enamels is in a little steel
      mortar with water.  I found out from personal experience that the
      best plan as soon as the enamels are ground is to pour off the water
      in which you grind them and put the powder in a little glass,
      pouring upon it just so much aqua fortis as may suffice to cover it;
      &amp; so let it stand for about one-eighth of an hour. This done,
      take out your enamel and wash it well in a glass bottle with very
      clear, clean water until no residue of impurity be left. You must
      know that the object of the aqua fortis is to clean it of any fatty,
      just as fresh water is to clean it of any earthy impurities. When
      your enamels are all well washed in this way, you should put each in
      its little jar of glass ware or majolica, but take great care that
      your water is so contained that it does not dry up, because if you
      put fresh water to them your enamels will spoil at once. Now pay
      great attention to what I’m next going to tell you. If you want your
      enamels to come out properly you must take a nice clean piece of
      paper, and chew well between your teeth, that’s to say if you’ve got
      any,—I couldn’t do it because I’ve none left,—so should have to
      soften it and beat it up with a little hammer of iron or wood,
      whichever might be best; this done you must wash out your paper
      putty, and squeeze it till there is no water left in it, because you
      will have to use it as a sponge and apply it from time to time upon
      your enamels. The more your colours dry up during the process the
      better they will look afterwards. Then, too, I mustn’t forget to
      tell you another important thing which will also affect the good or
      bad enamelling of your work, and this necessitates your trying a
      piece of experimental work first.</p>

    <p>To this end you take a plate of gold or silver, whichever material
      you elect to cut your intaglio upon, and on this experimental
      piece,—let us suppose it is gold,—put all the different colours with
      which you intend to work, having made as many little hollows with
      your graver as there are enamels. Thus you take a little bit of
      each, and the only object of this is to make the necessary
      preliminary trial, for by this trial you find out which run easy and
      which run hard, because it is very necessary that they should all
      run alike; for if some run too slowly and others too fast they would
      spoil each other, and you would make a mess of your work. All those
      preliminaries done, you may set to work at your enamelling; lay the
      nice clean colours over your engraved bas-relief just as if you were
      painting, always keeping your colours well covered up, and take no
      more out of one bottle than you can conveniently use at a time. It
      is usual, too, to fashion an instrument called a
      ‘<i lang="it">palettiere</i>’ (palette holder), this is made out of
      thin copper plate, &amp; in imitation of fingers, it should not be
      bigger than your fingers, and there should be five or six of them.
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span> Then you take a lump
      of lead in the shape of a pear, with an iron stem to it, which would
      correspond to the stalk of the pear, and then you put all your bits
      of copper which you have hollowed out somewhat, one over the other
      on your pear stem. And this little finger-shaped palette you stand
      beside your work, and you put your enamels upon it, one by one,
      using due care. How careful you have to be with this cannot be told
      in words alone—you’ll have to learn that by experience!</p>

    <p>As I said above, enamelling is similar to painting; though the
      mediums in the two sorts of painting in colours are oil &amp; water,
      while that of painting in enamels is by dissolving them with
      heat. To begin with then, take your enamels with a little copper
      palette knife, &amp; spread them out little by little very carefully
      over your bas-relief, putting on any colour you like, be it flesh
      colour, red, peacock blue, tawny, azure, grey or capucin colour, for
      that is what one of the colours is called. I don’t mention yellow,
      white &amp; turquoise blue, because those colours are not suitable
      to gold. But one colour I forgot, and that was ‘Aqua Marina,’ a most
      beautiful colour, which may be used for gold as well as for
      silver. Then when you have all your enamels of all colours placed in
      the best of orders, you have to be careful in the first coat, as it
      is called, to apply them very thin and neatly, and just as if you
      were painting in miniature you put each in its place, exactly where
      it is to be. This done, have your furnace in order, &amp; well
      heated with charcoal. Later on I will tell you further of furnaces
      and point out which are the best of the many different ones in use;
      but now let us assume that you have in it a fire sufficient for the
      purpose of the work you have before you. Then having your furnace as
      I say, in its place, you must put your gold work on an iron plate a
      trifle larger than the work itself, so that it can be handled with
      the tongs. And you must so ply it with the tongs and hold it to the
      mouth of the furnace, that it gets warm gradually, then, little by
      little, put it into the middle of the furnace, but you must take the
      greatest possible care that as soon as the enamel begins to move,
      you do not let it run, but draw it away from the fire quickly, so,
      however, that you do not subject it to any sudden cooling. Then,
      when it is quite cool, apply, just as carefully as before, the
      second coat of enamel, put it in the furnace in the same way, this
      time to a rather stronger fire, and draw it forth in the same manner
      as before. After this if you see your work need further touching up
      with enamel in any of its corners, as is often necessary, judgment
      and care will show you how to do it. For this I advise you to make a
      stronger and clearer fire, adding fresh charcoal, and so put your
      work in again, subjecting it to as strong a heat as enamel and gold
      can stand. Then rapidly take it out, and let your ’prentice be
      ready, bellows in hand, to blow upon it as quickly as possible and
      so cool it. This you have
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span> to do for the sake of
      the red enamel, the ‘<i lang="it">smalto roggio</i>’ of which we
      spoke above, because in the last firing it is wont to fuse with the
      others, and so to make new colour effects, the red, for instance,
      going so yellow that you can scarce distinguish it from gold. This
      fusing is technically called ‘<i lang="it">aprire</i>.’ When it has
      once more cooled you put it in again, but this time with a much
      weaker fire, until you see it little by little reddening, but take
      great heed that when it has got the good colour you want, you draw
      it rapidly from the fire &amp; cool it with the bellows, because too
      much firing will give it so strong a colour as to make it almost
      black.</p>

    <p>When you have duly carried out all these processes to your
      satisfaction, take some of your ‘<i lang="it">frassinelle</i>’—these
      were the bits of stones or sand that I described before when I told
      you about King Francis’ filigree bowl—and with them smooth your work
      over until you get the proper effect.  Then finish by polishing it
      with tripoli as I showed you above, also in the filigree bowl. This
      method of finishing, which is by far the best and safest, is called
      hand-polishing, in contradistinction to a second method by which,
      after you have your work smoothed with the
      ‘<i lang="it">frasinella</i>’ and then well washed with fresh water
      so as to remove from it all dirt, you put it again on to the iron
      plate and into a clear fire and thus slowly heat it. In this method,
      by which you get the effect of polish much quicker than with the
      other, you leave the work in the fire till it is hot, and the
      enamels begin to run; but its disadvantage is that, as the enamels
      always shrink a bit, and shrink unequally in the firing, you cannot
      get so even a surface as by the hand-polishing. You have to take the
      same precautions, too, as you took when firing your
      ‘<i lang="it">roggio clero</i>,’ or red enamel. In the event of your
      not employing the latter—as would be the case on silver—you must
      take great care to observe the same precautions in putting your work
      in, but do just the opposite in taking it out of the fire, that is
      to say draw it very gradually from the furnace, so that it cools
      very slowly instead of very rapidly as was the case with the red
      enamel. Of course you may have to enamel a lot of pieces, such for
      instance as little pendants, and bits of <ins class="corr" id="jewellery"
title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: jewelry">jewellery</ins>, and other such
      things, where you are not able to use the
      ‘<i lang="it">frasinella</i>’ at all. Things of this kind, fruit,
      leaves, little animals, tiny masks and such like, are applied in the
      same way with well-ground and washed enamels, but cannot be
      similarly polished because of their relief.</p>

    <p>And if by reason of the great time and labour and patience you
      spend upon the doing of all this your enamels begin to dry up, and
      thus fall off in turning your work, this you may remedy in this
      wise: take a few quince seeds, which you get by cutting the fruit
      through the middle,
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span> choose such as are
      not empty, and let them soak in a vase with a little water; this you
      should do over night if you want to enamel the next morning, and you
      should be careful to do it very clean. Then when you want to apply
      your enamels, having put a morsel of each colour on your palette
      (the finger palette I described to you above fixed on to the stem of
      your leaden pear) you mix with every bit of enamel you lay on your
      work, a tiny drop of this quince-seed-water, the effect of which is
      to produce a kind of gum which holds the enamels together so that
      they don’t fall, &amp; no other gum has a like effect. For the rest,
      all you have to do is to carefully carry out the methods I have so
      far explained to you, and whether your enamel be on gold or silver,
      except in so far as I have told, those methods are the same.</p>

        IV. JEWELLERY.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">Now let us discuss jewellery, and of what
      pertains to precious stones. Of such there are four only, and those
      four are made by the four elements, the ruby is made by fire, the
      sapphire most obviously by the air, the emerald by the earth, and
      the diamond by water.  In its due place I shall have something to
      say of the virtue of each. But what we have before us here is to
      talk about what pertains to the setting, in pendants, bracelets,
      rings, tiaras and crowns. We will leave diamonds till the last,
      because they are the most difficult of all stones to treat, and the
      reason of this is that while of other stones set in gold each one
      has its foil, of which more anon, the diamond of certain varieties
      has a tint which has to be specially prepared at the back of the
      stone, according to the peculiarities of each; and in their place
      will I tell you the loveliest things about them.</p>

    <p>We will begin with rubies, of which there are various sorts. The
      first is the oriental ruby, which is found in our side of the Levant
      and near home; this part of the Levant, indeed, produces rarer and
      more beautiful jewels than any other lands. These Levant rubies have
      a mature colour, they are deep and very fiery. The rubies of the
      West on the other hand, though still red, lean towards peacock
      colour and are somewhat sharp and crude. Northern rubies are sharper
      and cruder still, while those of the South are quite different from
      the others, but so rare that they are very seldom to be met with, so
      I will mention one of their peculiarities only, they have not the
      same grand colour as the Levant ruby, but verge somewhat upon that
      of the ballas,<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27"
      class="fnanchor">[27]</a> and though this has not the beautiful
      suffused colour it is none the less fiery, and so grand is it that
      they seem perpetually to scintillate by day, and by night throw out
      a gleam akin to that of a glow-worm, or other little creatures that
      shine in the dark. True it is that these southern rubies do not
      always possess this wonderful quality, but so delightful are they to
      the eye, that your good jeweller easily tells them from the others,
      the name carbuncle is, however, only applied to the very rare ones,
      and those that shine in the dark. As soon as we have considered,
      from personal experience, and from the experience of others, what
      are the best ways of setting jewels, we will talk of the qualities
      of the stones themselves. But I have a thing or two to say in order
      not to scandalize a certain class of men who call themselves
      jewellers, but may be better likened to hucksters or linen-drapers,
      pawn-brokers, and grocers; I have seen more than enough of wondrous
      samples
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span> in plenty of them in
      Rome, and there you may still see them to this day, with a maximum
      of credit and a minimum of brains. So what I say is out of respect
      to these dunderheads lest they should be shocked at my affirming
      that the real stones are of four sorts only, and thus wag their
      arrogant tongues at me &amp; cry, ‘How about the chrysoprase or the
      jacynth, how about the spinell, how about the aqua marine; nay,
      more, how about the garnet, the vermeil, the <ins class="corr" 
      id="chrysolite" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: crysolite">chrysolite</ins>, the plasma,
      the amethyst, ain’t these all stones and all different?’ Yes, and
      why the Devil won’t you add pearls, too, among the jewels, ain’t
      they fish bones? I really don’t think it worth while to try and cope
      with veritable empty-headed ignoramuses, but I will say that there
      are many, very many, like them, and that your great princes are
      mainly to blame for encouraging them, since they quite put
      themselves in the hands of such men, and so not only do injury to
      themselves, but undervalue men that walk in the right way and do
      excellent work. But let us pass from this little digression &amp;
      consider what is most beautiful and most rare in jewellery; a
      digression merely entered into because I don’t want ignorant men to
      jeer at me for having said nothing of the ballas and the topaz. The
      ballas is a ruby with but little colour, as if it were a kind of
      feminine form of the stone, called in the West the ballas ruby, but
      it is of the same hardness, and so a gem of the nature of the ruby,
      and differing from it only as to cost. The like holds good with the
      topaz, in its relationship to the sapphire, it is of the same
      hardness as the sapphire, and though of a different colour must be
      classified with the sapphire, just as the ballas must be with the
      ruby—what better classification do you want? hasn’t the air got its
      sun?</p>

    </figure>

    <p>Of these four sorts of stones, the ruby, the sapphire, the emerald,
      and the diamond, you must know that the first is far the most
      costly. A ruby, for instance, of five grains of wheat, &amp; of as
      fine a fire as you could wish, would be worth about 800 golden
      scudi, and an emerald of the same size and beauty would run to about
      400, similarly a diamond would be worth 100, &amp; no more, while a
      sapphire would fetch about 10. These few facts I thought might be
      worth having to all those many youths always springing up and eager
      to learn the beautiful art of the goldsmith. To be sure, they ought
      to begin learning as soon as they can toddle, &amp; use that
      greatest of all opportunities which is afforded by apprenticeship to
      some Master of renown, whether in Rome, in Venice, or in Paris. In
      all of them did I sojourn for a long while, and in all of them did I
      see and handle many and invaluable pieces of jewellery.</p>

        A RUBY.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">We will now continue our talk &amp; consider the
      way of setting a ruby, and the box of gold in which it has to be
      fitted. This box, whether in a pendant, a ring, or what not, is
      always called the bezel. What you have first of all to observe in
      the setting of the stone in this bezel, is that the former must not
      be set too deep, so as to deprive it of its full value, nor too
      high, so as to isolate it from its surrounding detail. I mention
      this because I have seen mistakes made in both ways, and I am
      certain that practising jewellers who have a right knowledge of
      drawing and design would not go wrong in either the one direction or
      the other.</p>

    <p>So let us place our fine ruby into its bezel. In order to what is
      technically called ‘set’<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28"
      class="fnanchor">[28]</a> it, we must provide ourselves with four or
      five ruby foils<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29"
      class="fnanchor">[29]</a> of which some should be of so deep a glow
      that they seem quite dark, and others differing in intensity till
      they have scarce any red in them at all. With all these different
      specimens of foils before us, we take hold of the ruby with a piece
      of hard black wax well pointed, pressing the wax upon one of the
      projections of the stone. Then your good jeweller tries his ruby now
      upon this foil, now upon that, till his own good taste determines
      him which foil will give most value to his stone.  Sometimes the
      jeweller will find it may help him to move the stone to and from the
      foil, but he has to recollect that the air between the foil &amp;
      the stone will always give an effect different to that afterwards
      given when the stone is set in the bezel where no air passes
      behind. Therefore your capable man places the cut foil in the
      setting, at one time bringing it close, at another interposing a
      space. Thereupon let him set his jewel with all the care, taste
      &amp; delicacy of which an able man is master.</p>

      <h3 id="CHAPTER_VI_HOW_TO_SET_AN">CHAPTER VI. HOW TO
        SET AN EMERALD AND A SAPPHIRE.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">Now, as to the emerald and the sapphire, the same
      skill must be used with the foils adaptable to them as with those of
      the ruby.  And because I consider that practice always has come
      before theory in every craft, and that the rules of theory, in which
      your skillful craftsman is accomplished, are always grafted on to
      practice afterwards, I will give you a case in point of what once
      happened to me when I was setting a ruby of about 3000 scudi in
      value. This ruby had, when it came into my hands, been very well set
      at different times by some of the best known jewellers of the
      day. So I was incited to work at it with all possible care. Seeing
      that I could in no way satisfy myself with the result of my efforts,
      I locked myself up somewhere where no one could see me; not so much
      because I did not wish my secret to go further, but because I did
      not want to be caught trying so mean an experiment upon so goodly
      and wonderful a gem. I took a little skein of silk stained with
      Kermes, and with a pair of scissors cut it carefully, having
      previously spread a little wax in the bezel. Then I took the tiny
      bit of silk and pressed<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30"
      class="fnanchor">[30]</a> it firmly on to the wax with the point of
      a small punch.  Then did I put my ruby upon it, and so well did it
      make, and such virtue did it gain, that all the jeweller folk who
      had seen it first, suspected me of having tinted it, a thing
      forbidden in jewellery except in the case of diamonds, of which more
      anon. But for this ruby, some of the jewellers asked me to say what
      kind of a foil I had put behind it, upon which I answered that I had
      put no foil behind it. At this reply of mine, a jeweller who was
      with the gentleman to whom the ruby belonged, said, ‘If the ruby has
      no foil, you can’t have done anything else but tint it in some way
      or other, and that you know is forbidden.’ To which I replied again
      that I had neither given it a foil, nor done anything forbidden to
      it. At this the jeweller got a little nasty and used strong
      language, at which the gentleman who owned the ruby said,
      ‘Benvenuto, I pray you, be so good, provided I pay you for it, to
      open your setting and show it to me only, I promise you I’ll not
      tell anyone your secret.’ Then said I to him that I had worked
      several days on the job, and that I had my living to earn, but that
      I would willingly do it if he paid me the price of the setting, and,
      moreover, do it in the presence of all of them, because I should be
      much honoured in thus being able to teach my teachers. When I had
      said this, I opened the bezel and took out the stone in their
      presence.  They were very much obliged, we parted very good friends,
      and I got
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span> very well paid. The
      ruby in question was a thick one, &amp; so limpid and luminous that
      all the foils you put beneath it gave it a sort of uncertain flash,
      like that which shimmers from the girasol opal, or the cat’s-eye,
      two kinds of stones to which the dunderheads, of whom I told before,
      would also give the name of gems.</p>

    <p>Now a word about the emerald and the sapphire, in both which gems
      one meets with the same peculiarities and difficulties as with the
      ruby, so I know of but little to say about them than that they are
      stones that are often falsified, which should be a warning to those
      who delight in gems or buy them, whether to set or to keep. There is
      a kind of Indian ruby with as little colour as you can possibly
      imagine, and I once saw a ruby of this nature falsified ever so
      cleverly by one of these cheats. He had done it by smearing its base
      with dragon’s blood, which is a kind of composition made of a gum
      that will melt in the fire, and that you can buy at any apothecary’s
      in Florence or Rome. Well, the cheat had smeared the base of the
      stone with dragon’s blood, &amp; then set it in such a way that it
      showed so well, you would gladly have given 100 golden scudi for it;
      but without this colour it wouldn’t have fetched 10, and have been
      much more likely to come out of the setting. But the colour looked
      so fine, and the stone seemed so cunningly set, that no one unless
      very careful, would have spotted it.</p>

    <p>It happened one day that I was with three old jewellers to whom I
      had expressed my doubts as to the genuineness of the stone, so they
      made me unset the ruby and they stood round me greedily watching,
      ready to pounce upon it. As soon as I had done it they all three
      jeered at me for my wisdom and said another time I should open my
      eyes better, for it was obvious that this stone was set by a good
      man, who wouldn’t do such a thing, and who knew his business right
      well enough. At these words of theirs I held out my hand, and begged
      them to let me see and have proof of my mistake, adding that if this
      time my good eyes had failed me, it might be because I was less
      keen-sighted than they, but I promised it shouldn’t happen
      again. When I had the ruby in my hand I soon saw with my sharp eyes
      what their dullness had missed, and quickly taking a little steel
      tool I scraped off the bottom of the stone. Then might that ruby
      have been likened to the crow that tricked itself out in the
      feathers of the peacock. I returned the stone to the jewellers and
      suggested to them that they would do well to provide themselves with
      eyes somewhat superior to those they were at present using. I
      couldn’t resist saying this because all three of them wore great big
      gig-lamps on their noses, whereupon they all three gaped at each
      other, shrugged their shoulders, and, with God’s blessing, made
      off. You come across similar
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span> difficulties and
      occurrences with emeralds and sapphires which I will omit, as I have
      other things of more importance to tell of.</p>

    <p>I mind me also of having seen rubies and emeralds made double, like
      red &amp; green crystals, stuck together, the stone being in two
      pieces, and their usual name is ‘doppie’ or doublets. These false
      stones are made in Milan, set in silver, and are much in vogue among
      the peasant folk; the ingenuity of man has devised them to satisfy
      the wants of these poor people when they wish to make presents at
      weddings, ceremonies, and so forth, to their wives, who of course
      don’t know any difference between the real and the sham stone, &amp;
      whom the little deceit makes very happy.  Certain avaricious men
      however, have taken advantage of a form of industry, made partly for
      a useful, and partly for a good end, &amp; have very cunningly
      turned it to great evil. For instance, they have taken a thin piece
      of Indian ruby, and with very cunning setting have twisted and
      pieced together beneath it bits of glass which they then fixed in
      this manner in an elaborate &amp; beautiful setting for the ring or
      whatever it was.  And these they have subsequently sold for a good
      and first-class stone.  And forasmuch as I don’t tell you anything
      unless I can illustrate it by some practical example, I’ll just
      mention that there was in my time a Milanese jeweller who had so
      cleverly counterfeited an emerald in this way that he sold it for a
      genuine stone and got 9000 golden scudi for it.  And this all
      happened because the purchaser—who was no less a person than the
      King of England—put rather more faith in the jeweller than he ought
      to have done. The fraud was not found out till several years
      after.</p>

    <p>Emeralds and sapphires are also manufactured out of single stones,
      and this so cleverly that they are often difficult to tell, but
      however wonderfully they are counterfeited in colour they are so
      soft, that any good jeweller with the average amount of brains, can
      easily spot them. I could tell you ever so much more about all this,
      but it must do for the present, because I have to pass on to a lot
      of other important and useful things.</p>

        MAKE FOILS FOR ALL SORTS OF TRANSPARENT JEWELS.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">In order to make good foils for jewels it is
      essential to have steel tools, and all of the best and of the most
      finished description. Then, as you may suppose, for an undertaking
      of such importance you need the greatest possible care and patience,
      together with the greatest possible neatness. Long ago, when I was a
      lad of fifteen and began to learn goldsmithery, I knew a master in
      the art whose name was Salvestro del Lavacchio. This man only did
      stone-setting, &amp; specialised on the making of his own foils for
      all sorts of gems. Though the foils from France and Venice and other
      places often showed up more splendidly, experience proved that they
      were not as lasting as Lavacchio’s, which were always thicker. For
      this reason the setting of the gems upon them was often more
      difficult than on the foreign foils, but so strong were they, and so
      telling to the gems, that as soon as they became a bit known, he got
      orders from all over the world and soon had no time for anything
      else but foil-making. Indeed it requires all a man’s energies to do
      this, so I thought I would give a few facts about it for the benefit
      of anyone anxious to learn. The first foil is called the common
      foil, it is of a yellow colour and is used for many jewels and
      transparent stones. But first a word as to the weight of a carat,
      which is a weight of four grains.  The foils may be stated in
      weights thus:—</p>

    <p>Melt the copper well first and then put in the two other metals;
      when they are well mixed cast them into a fairly long ingot mould,
      and don’t make it too thick.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31"
      class="fnanchor">[31]</a> When it is cast let it cool, then file it
      well, after which beat it very lightly and with the broad end of a
      hammer, often heating it again as you go on, <ins id="butnot" class="corr" 
      title="Transcriber's Note&mdash; Errata original text: but">but not</ins>  
      putting it in water, nor cooling it with the bellows. And when you
      have beaten it down to about the thickness of two knife backs;
      flatten it with a strong rounded scraper,
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span> and pare off the
      edges quite smoothly till no crack remain. Then, when you are
      spreading it out, see that both it and your hammer be even, smooth,
      and burnished, and with every possible care make it as thin as you
      can, as, according to its nature, the metal will rend; the size of
      it should be about a couple of fingers, or a little longer, and the
      square should be of such dimensions as your metal will afford. Also
      mind that the size is such as you propose to make when your work is
      completed.  But as, in beating, it will rend and crack, see that you
      watch this, and cut it accordingly, and to the utmost thinness
      possible. And all these pieces you must blanch, clean, and polish
      with tartar,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32"
      class="fnanchor">[32]</a> salt, and water, which is the blanching
      liquor ordinarily used for silver. Then wash in clear water, rub
      with a clean rag lightly, and then scrub it on a big copper tube
      that must be very clean and shining.</p>

    <p>See that you scrape it with the sharpest of all possible
      goldsmiths’ scrapers, and do this with the greatest care in order
      that you do not mark it with notches. Then take it with a very clean
      and white cloth, and have by you a graver that shall be well
      sharpened on an oil stone, and clean off everything in the nature of
      grease or dirt. It is needful, when burnishing it, to be in a room
      where there is no dirt. Get a black hæmatite
      stone<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33"
      class="fnanchor">[33]</a> such as the sword cutlers use for
      burnishing gold. When you have polished it very well give it its
      colour. This you do over a moderate and clean fire, keeping your
      piece of foil near the said fire, and take care that of the two
      sides, the unburnished one turns to the fire.  Gradually you will
      see the colour come according as it takes the heat.  It is necessary
      to vary the colour as need requires.</p>

    <p>Pope Clement gave me the commission to make the button for his
      cope.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34"
      class="fnanchor">[34]</a> This morse I made about the size of an
      ordinary plate; but because of all its wealth of figure work I had
      better talk of that later when I treat of embossing and the many
      difficulties of that art. For the present I will consider only the
      jewels with which it was enriched. In the middle of the morse I set
      a diamond the facets of which were cut starwise to a point, for
      which Pope Julius II. had given 36,000 ducats of the Camera. I set
      the stone quite free (<i lang="it">à jour</i>) between four claws,
      in this manner did it seem to me to make better. I had given this
      setting a good deal of thought, but the stone was of such
      exceptional beauty that it caused me much less trouble than costly
      stones of similar character are wont to do. True, some jewellers
      were of a mind that it would be better to tint the whole base of the
      stone
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span> and the back
      facets,<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35"
      class="fnanchor">[35]</a> but with my good results I got them to see
      that it was much better thus. Together with the diamond, and around
      it, were two large ballas rubies and two big sapphires, splendid
      stones, and four emeralds of a goodly size. To all these stones did
      I apply those same careful methods of which I have spoken above,
      thereby satisfying not only the Pope, but also the practising
      artists. For, previously, at the beginning of the work, and before I
      set to at the diamonds and the other stones—for they were right
      difficult to handle—certain old fossils in the art had, part in
      envy, part speaking true, sought to scare<a id="FNanchor_36"
      href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> me away from the
      job. ‘Verily,’ said they, ‘we know you to be sure enough in all that
      pertains to design &amp; to the embossing of an excellent piece of
      work, but when you set to the tinting and arranging of such costly
      jewels, why, ’twill make the teeth chatter in your head with
      fright.’ Now I’m not the sort of fellow who’s afeard of any mortal
      thing, but I must say that this somewhat emphatic way of expressing
      their astonishment made me pause a bit. But I minded me of those
      gifts from God Himself, &amp; which come to a man without any toil
      of his own; comeliness for instance, or strength, or handiness, and
      to me methought God had given surety of purpose. So much was this
      so, that I could afford to turn laughing away from all their silly
      prattle. The tale of Phœbus came to my mind, and how at the outset
      he had sought to fright his son Phæton from wishing to guide the
      chariot of the sun; but then, you see, when all was done, I was
      luckier than Phæton, for I did not break my neck, but came out of it
      with much honour and profit to myself.</p>

      <h3 id="CHAPTER_VIII_ON_THE_CUTTING">CHAPTER
        VIII. ON THE CUTTING OF THE DIAMOND.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">As we have now said enough of the three gems,
      ruby, emerald, and sapphire, we must perforce consider at greater
      length the diamond. Now, though the diamond is said to be kin to
      water, let no man suppose that this need imply an absence of colour,
      perfume, and taste such as would be the case in good water. Just as
      water may have both colour, perfume, and taste, even so the diamond;
      not that the diamond actually <em>has</em> perfume or taste, but it
      has colours as many as nature herself. I propose here only to
      mention two, and these diamonds about as splendid as it is possible
      to imagine. The first was a stone I came across in the reign of Pope
      Clement, a diamond literally flesh-coloured, most tender, most
      limpid, it scintillated like a star, and so delightful was it to
      behold that all other diamonds beside it, however pure &amp;
      colourless, seemed no longer to give any pleasure and to lose their
      gratefulness. The second was a stone I saw in Mantua, it was green,
      &amp; green such as you might see in a very pale emerald, but it
      shone just like any diamond, and as no emerald ever shone; indeed it
      seemed the most glorious of all emeralds. Though I have seen all
      imaginable colours in diamonds, the mention of these two may
      suffice.</p>

    <p>Now for just a word about the cutting of the diamond, that is to
      say on the changing of the stone from its roughness into those
      lovely shapes so familiar to us, the Table, the Facetted, &amp; the
      Point.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37"
      class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Diamonds you can never cut alone, you must
      always do two at a time on account of their exceeding hardness, no
      other stone can cut them; it is a case of diamond cut diamond. This
      you do by means of rubbing one against the other until a form is
      obtained such as your skilful cutter may wish to produce, and with
      the diamond powder that falls from them in the process, the final
      polish is subsequently given. For this purpose the stones are set in
      little cups of pewter<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38"
      class="fnanchor">[38]</a> and held against a wheel by means of
      certain little pinchers prepared on purpose, and they are thus held
      with their dust mixed with oil. The steel wheel upon which the
      diamonds are cut and finished should be about the thickness of a
      finger, &amp; the size of an open hand and of the finest steel
      excellently tempered. This wheel is fastened to a hand mill and
      turned round as fast as it is possible to turn it. Four to five
      diamonds, or even six, can be applied to the wheel at the same time,
      and by bringing to bear a sufficiently heavy weight you can increase
      the pressure of the diamonds upon the wheel and give greater grip to
      the dust which wears them away, and so they are finished. I
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span> could tell you a deal
      more, and all about the ways of cutting, but because it is not in my
      own craft, I will not bore you with it; ’tis sufficient for me to
      have given a general sketch of the method in question.</p>

    <p>To return however to the subject we have in hand, I will say
      something of the tinting of the diamond, of its setting in gold, and
      of the variation between one stone &amp; another on account of the
      above-mentioned colours. However great the variety of these colours
      is, the wondrous hardness of the stone is similar in all cases, or
      at least the variation is so slight that the process of cutting is
      the same. With the greatest possible care will I show how I set
      about making tints for diamonds, and give likewise a number of
      instances, on various exceptional occasions, that I have come across
      in diamonds of great importance: it is only owing to experiences
      such as I have passed through that one is able satisfactorily to
      show the great difficulties that stand in the way of those who wish
      to make them fine settings. I will begin with one occasion when Pope
      Paul III. of the house of Farnese was given a diamond by the Emperor
      Charles V.,—’twas when he returned from the capture of Tunis &amp;
      paid a visit to the Pope in Rome. The diamond in question was
      purchased in Venice by certain servants of the Emperor’s for 12,000
      scudi, and it was set merely in a plain and simple bezel with a
      little claw.<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39"
      class="fnanchor">[39]</a> In this fashion it was given by the
      Emperor to the Pope, as soon as he visited him, &amp; I heard tell
      that he gave it as a sign of his goodwill and friendliness, the
      latter receiving it courteously with the same spirit. Now forasmuch
      as the Pope, for a month previously, had ordered a present to be
      prepared for the Emperor, worthy to pass between them, he had held
      much counsel on the matter with many, and so called for me, and
      asked me in the presence of his Council, but quite privately, to
      give him my opinion on the matter. I straightway said that, inasmuch
      as the Pope was the veritable head of the Christian religion, and
      the veritable vicar of Christ, the most fitting gift from the Pope
      to the Emperor seemed to me to be a fine Christ of gold set upon a
      ground of lapis lazuli, an azure stone from which they make
      ultramarine; the foot of this crucifix I said should be of gold
      &amp; set with jewels, and of such value as should please his
      Holiness. And because I had, with great care, already executed three
      gold figures that might serve for the base of this cross, &amp;
      because they symbolised Faith, Hope, and Charity, and were already
      completed, the suggestion pleased the Pope mightily, and he bade me
      set to &amp; make a model of what I proposed, for him to see.</p>

    <figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="breviary" >
      <img class="w100" src="images/i_p032a.jpg" alt="">
      <figcaption class="caption">The South Kensington Breviary and
        another Cellini attribution</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>At this model I wrought for a day and a half, and then brought it
      to him completed. Pleased as he had been at my suggestion, he was
      simply
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span> delighted when he saw
      the model, and determined to give me the job; we clinched the
      bargain in no time, I was paid the earnest money and bidden to
      bestir myself. I strained every nerve to bring this beautiful work
      to being, but so it was, I was hindered from finishing by certain
      beasts who had the vantage of the Pope’s ear. ’Tis a thing that
      often happens, this, with all princes; the worst men in the whole
      court are often the best listened to, and these fellows believe for
      them what they don’t even believe themselves. One of these men
      whispered such evil things into the Pope’s ear, that he got him to
      believe that it would be better to make a present to the Emperor of
      a breviary of the Virgin in miniature that had been made for the
      Cardinal Hippolitus de Medici as a gift to the Lady Julia Gonzaga,
      that this little book should be bound in a cover of fine gold set
      with what variety of stones might please his Holiness, and that the
      Emperor would like this much better, because he could make a present
      of it to his wife the Empress. And so it came that the Pope got so
      gammoned, that he was dissuaded from the crucifix, and bade me make
      the little book, which I accordingly did.<a id="FNanchor_40"
      href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> When the Emperor
      arrived in Rome, I had not yet put the finishing touches on the book
      because it took some time before they made up their minds about it;
      none the less the cover was visible, as it had all been put
      together, and it looked splendid with all its gorgeous jewels set
      upon it. Then the Pope sent to let me know that I must have it in
      order as well as I possibly could within three or four days, as he
      wanted to show it, incomplete as it was, to the Emperor, and that he
      would excuse me to the latter for not having completed it, on the
      plea of illness. As for that I will speak of it in its place.</p>

    <p>After this the Pope with his own hands gave me the diamond he had
      received from the Emperor, told me to take the measure of his
      forefinger and make him a ring as richly wrought as possible and as
      quickly as ever I could. Off I hurried to my workshop, and with the
      greatest dispatch and in the space of two days produced as rich a
      ring as was ever made.  Now Pope Paul had waiting in attendance on
      him a number of Milanese who patronised a certain Milanese jeweller,
      Gaio by name. This Gaio came before the Pope, and all off his own
      bat, without ever having been as much as asked, ‘Holy Father,’ quoth
      he, ‘your Holiness knows that by profession I am a jeweller, &amp;
      that I am better skilled at my craft than any man ever born. Now
      your Holiness has given Benvenuto a diamond to set, and the diamond
      is one of the most difficult stones in the whole world to set, and
      this particular diamond is more difficult than any other diamond,
      and it is a very beautiful stone, and a very costly stone &amp;
      withal
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span> a very delicate
      stone, &amp; Benvenuto is a very young man, and though he is
      enthusiastic enough about his art, &amp; apt enough at his work, the
      tinting of so precious a stone is rather too tough a bone for tender
      gums like his. In my opinion your Holiness would do well to
      commission two or three old and tried jewellers to go and look
      Benvenuto up &amp; not let him tint the diamond without their
      advice. It was a jeweller called Miliano <ins class="corr" id="Larg" 
title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Larghett">Targhett</ins>a of Venice, your
      Holiness, who tinted and set the stone as your Holiness has it at
      present. This was an old man, and never did any one better know how
      to fix foils and tint stones.’</p>

    <p>Weary of this plaguey babbler, the Pope told him he might go and do
      what he liked &amp; thought best. So off the fellow went to look for
      Raphaello del Moro the Florentine, and Guasparri Romanesco, both of
      them men of great cunning in the matter of jewels; with these two he
      came to my shop on behalf of the Pope. Then did he begin to babble
      so tiresomely that I could scarce contain myself. The other two
      talked sense &amp; were decently civil, so I turned to them in my
      politest manner, explained to them my views and begged them to let
      me have a couple of days to prepare a few tints to try this lovely
      stone, for this could only do good. In the first place by trying a
      few rare tints for the diamond, I might be able not only to teach
      myself, but lure on others who were following the art, &amp; in the
      next place the stone might so gain at my cost, that it might delight
      them, do the Pope a service, and bring much credit to me. All the
      time I was giving them my reasons, that insolent beast of a Gaio
      kept fidgeting about with his feet and his head and his hands, ever
      and anon interjecting the most irritating words, so that I very
      nearly lost my temper altogether. But the others, men of sense they,
      managed it so that I got the time I asked for. As soon as they were
      gone, I set to like anything to make my tints, and this is how I did
      it.</p>

        TINT A DIAMOND.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">Take a very clean lamp with its cotton wick as
      white as possible, its oil, too, should be old, sweet and clear,
      then stand it on the ground, or, if you like, between two bricks. On
      the top of the two bricks put a concave copper disc, its upper
      surface cleanly polished, and its under surface acted upon by the
      flame to a third part of it, but not more. Be careful that only a
      very little soot collects on the disc at a time, because if too much
      soot comes, it may catch fire and be no use to you. Then, from time
      to time, while the flame smokes, take a little smooth paper and
      brush the smoke soot off the disc into a clean vessel.  You may know
      that the soot doesn’t catch fire till it grows to a coat the
      thickness of two big knife backs, so you needn’t fear to let it
      smoke itself to a thickness of one knife back at a time. Then you
      take mastic,<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41"
      class="fnanchor">[41]</a> a sort of gum that every apothecary sells,
      not, however, too fresh; you may know the fresh gum by its being
      bright and pale; on the other hand it mustn’t be too old, and the
      old gum you will know by its being yellow and dry, and of little
      substance. When you have chosen the right sort of mastic, neither
      too fresh nor too dry, you proceed to select from it the roundest
      and cleanest grains, because, you know, when they fall from the tree
      they are apt to absorb earth and other impurities. All this done, as
      I have told, you put a little pan of live charcoal on the bench, and
      heat at it some small pointed steel instrument, with which you
      proceed to spike one of the mastic grains, not, however, spiking it
      right through the middle. This you then hold nearer and nearer to
      the fire till it begins to get hot, when you quickly, with a little
      spittle on your fingers, squeeze the hot mastic grain; the result of
      this squeezing will be a tear-drop, as limpid and pure as you can
      possibly imagine. Then quickly cut it off with a pair of scissors
      from the dirty part of the grain, and save it in a clean place. This
      process you repeat till you have as many mastic tears as you
      need.</p>

    <p>Then you set to and make your linseed oil, &amp; this is how you do
      it. You pick out the cleanest and best grains, grains without insect
      holes and perfect, and place a handful at a time on a porphyry
      stone, or a very clean copper or iron plate. On this you spread the
      grains, and place over them an iron plate about one finger thick and
      five fingers square, this plate having been previously heated so
      that it would singe paper, but no hotter.  To the weight of it you
      add the pressure of some great hammer, and then you will soon begin
      to see the oil oozing out of the grains, but you
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span> must mind that your
      iron is neither too hot nor too cold, for if it be too cold the oil
      won’t ooze out, and if too hot it will be scorched up and bad, but
      if well-tempered the oil will be admirable. Then ever so carefully
      you lift up the plate and the grains, and with a clean knife scrape
      off the oil. You have also to note that what is first pressed from
      the grain is a little water, this you will tell by its running to
      the edges of the stone, while the genuine oil remains in the
      middle. Then you take the oil and put it into a clean glass
      vase. Next you have also to provide a little sweet almond oil; and
      some folk use olive oil two years old, not more, and very sweet and
      clean. Then you want a spoon about four times the size of an
      ordinary spoon, and have in readiness your pan of live charcoal. You
      put your tear drops of mastic into the spoon, and, with a very clean
      silver or copper spoon, you begin to melt them over the fire. When
      your mastic is melting you add a little of the grain oil to it, in
      proportion about one part of linseed to six of mastic, and so mix
      the two liquids together, then apply the third, be it oil of olive
      or almond. After they are fused you add a little purified
      turpentine, and finally the lampblack you prepared to begin with,
      putting just so much &amp; no more, as you need for your tint.</p>

    <p>Divers sorts of diamonds require some a darker, some a lighter
      tint; some again need a softer, some a harder tint, and so it is
      necessary, whenever you are setting a diamond of great importance,
      to try it with the hard and the soft, or with the dark and the light
      in accordance with the quality of the stone and the judgment of the
      good jeweller. Some have put as little lampblack as possible when
      tinting a diamond that seemed too yellow, and have instead mixed
      with their tint indigo, a blue colour known to every painter. They
      have even let indigo entirely take the place of lampblack, &amp;
      this did they do when they tinted a diamond that looked like clear
      topaz. In these cases was a dark tint applied with admirable effect,
      and for this reason, by mixing the two colours, blue and yellow,
      they make green, hence the yellow diamond with the blue tint made an
      admirable water; and, if it be well applied, it becomes one colour,
      neither yellow as heretofore nor blue owing to the virtue of the
      tint, but a variation, in truth, most gracious to the eye. Inasmuch
      as all stones have, then, to be treated in accordance with the
      ability of the master and the quality of the stone, the cunning with
      which you treat them will depend on the amount of your experience in
      the art applied to each particular stone, and each several
      occasion.</p>

    <p>Now to return to that big diamond, a notable example of its kind,
      that I set for Pope Paul, and which I had only to tint, because the
      setting was already made. As I told you, I had asked Rafaello,
      Guasparri and Gaio to allow me some two days’ space; during this
      time I made a set of experiments
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span> in tints, and by
      great labour produced a composition which made a much finer effect
      beneath the diamond than had been made by the master, Miliano
      Targhetta. And when I had made sure that I had beaten so admirable a
      man, what did I do but set to work anew with still greater energy to
      see if I could not beat even myself. As I told you above, this
      particular diamond was a most peculiarly difficult one to manage
      because of its subtlety,<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42"
      class="fnanchor">[42]</a> and the good jeweller is he who produces
      his effect with the tint alone without having recourse to the
      reflector,<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43"
      class="fnanchor">[43]</a> about which I shall have occasion to speak
      in its place.</p>

    <p>When I had quite satisfied myself I sent to fetch the three old
      jewellers, and when they arrived I had arranged all my tints in
      order for them.  When the three appeared that presumptuous Gaio
      marched into the shop first, and seeing all my apparatus neatly
      ranged about for the purpose of tinting the stone in their presence,
      he straightaway began wagging his head, pumping about with his
      hands, and chattering. ‘Benvenuto,’ said he, ‘all this is mere
      sillyness, mere bagatelle, you just turn up again that tint of
      Master Miliano’s, and apply it, and don’t lose any time about it,
      because we haven’t any to waste, owing to all the important
      commissions we have to execute for the Pope.’ At this Raphaello
      seeing that I was just about to fly into a most terrible passion,
      interposed; he was a good fellow was Raphaello, and also the oldest
      of them, and he began to say soothing words to me, encouraging
      things, and such-like, and so just calmed me in time. The other man
      also, Master Guasparri Romanesco, in order to put a damper on that
      beast of a Gaio, he too began saying things, funny things which
      didn’t come off, because I wasn’t in a mood for funny things. After
      a bit, perceiving that I was getting to be a source of quarrel
      between the three men, I turned to them and spake thus: ‘God
      Almighty,’ said I, ‘has, with the gift of speech, granted to mortals
      four different ways of expressing themselves, and these are they:
      the first is called <em>to reason</em>, which means to explain the
      reason of things in a sensible way; the second is called <em>to
        talk</em>, which means to make words, words of good import that is,
      and which, if they don’t explain the reason of things, may yet be in
      the way of doing so; the third is called <em>to chatter</em>, and
      that means to say things of little value, funny things that
      sometimes please, and that don’t hurt you; the fourth is just
      to <em>grasshopper gabble</em>,<a id="FNanchor_44"
      href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> and nothing more, and
      that’s what people do who hav’n’t got any sense in their heads at
      all, and want to show it off as much as they can. So, my good
      friends, I will just reason with you, and expound to you my reasons.
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span> Master Raphaello, of
      a sooth, has talked elegant words, sound words; Master Guasparri, to
      cheer us up, has chattered a few amiable and funny things, none of
      which have got anything to do with what we have in hand; Gaio, what
      has he done? why just drivelled in the most sickening way, but since
      his grasshopper gabble hasn’t done me any special injury I’m not
      going to lose my temper over him, and shall just take no notice of
      him at all. So now I pray you, gentlemen, just to let me tint the
      diamond in your presence, &amp; if my tint does not turn out better
      than Master Miliano’s, I can still use his, and I shall have shown
      you how at least I have tried my best to improve it.’</p>

    <p>Scarce had I finished these words of mine when that beast of a Gaio
      called out, ‘So according to this I’m a driveller, am I?’ Whereupon
      the good Raphaello began soothing him down with amiable words till
      the beast got a bit pacified; I meantime set to work with my tints
      upon the diamond.  Raphaello and Guasparri were all agog to see me
      tint the diamond, and first I tinted it with my own tint, the first
      one, and this showed up so well that they were in doubt as to
      whether or not I had not surpassed that of Miliano; and they praised
      me abundantly. Then Raphaello turned to Gaio and said: ‘You see,
      Gaio, that Benvenuto’s tint, even if it has not surpassed Miliano’s,
      makes a close second; and so ’tis always right to give encouragement
      to a young man like Benvenuto who tries to do well.’ I turned to
      him, thanked Raphaello for his pleasant words, and said, ‘Now, my
      good friends, we’ll take out my tint, &amp; in your presence put in
      Master Miliano’s, and then shall we be better able to judge on which
      the diamond makes best.’ I quickly took out mine &amp; put in
      Miliano’s. Raphaello and Guasparri said that the stone showed better
      with mine, and all three said that I should re-apply my tint as
      rapidly as I could before the impression was lost to their
      eyes. Whereupon I replaced mine quickly and handed it them. All
      three were agreed, and Gaio before all—his ass’s face quite beaming
      up—and they declared most amiably that I was a clever fellow, that I
      had good reasons for my action, &amp; that I had beaten Master
      Miliano’s tint by a long way, a thing they never imagined
      possible. At this I made a bow, not without a little
      pride,<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45"
      class="fnanchor">[45]</a> but so as not to be noticed, and said to
      them: ‘Dear masters, since you have vouchsafed me such kind
      encouragement to so good an end, I am only too ready on my part to
      be judged by you, and since you admit that I have beaten Miliano,
      will you now decide whether or not I have beaten myself, only just
      give me a quarter of an hour’s grace?’</p>

    <p>Therewith I left them and went up to the attic of my house, where I
      had all in order that I wanted to do. What I did there I’ll tell you
      now, I’ve
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span> not told it anyone
      yet, and it brought me much honour in this diamond, but it does not
      necessarily succeed in others, and cannot be done without much
      labour and experience. I took a fair sized grain of mastic, cleared
      it well of its skin as I told above, so that it was as pure and
      bright as possible, &amp; with all imaginable delicacy, having well
      cleaned the diamond, spread it over the stone with the aid of a
      moderate fire. Then I let it cool, holding it tight with the tongs
      used for tinting. When dry and cool I had my black tint ready,
      spread the same carefully and before a gentle heat on the top of the
      clear coat of mastic. This method suited so well to the tenderness
      and peculiar water of the diamond in question, that it seemed to
      remove from it any internal imperfections &amp; make of it a stone
      of perfect quality. Then down I ran and put it into Master
      Raphaello’s hand. He uttered an expression of astonishment like you
      do when you see a miracle. The two others, Guasparri and Gaio,
      likewise expressed amazement, only more so, and praised me up to the
      skies, Gaio even so far let himself down as to begging my
      pardon. Then they said to me, all three of them together: ‘12,000
      scudi was the worth of this diamond before, but, of a truth, it is
      worth 20,000 now.’ We shook hands amicably and parted the best of
      friends.</p>

      <h3 id="CHAPTER_X_HOW_TO_GIVE_A">CHAPTER X. HOW TO
        GIVE A DIAMOND ITS REFLECTOR.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">In order not to leave out any of the few things
      that I have mastered, we will now discuss what is termed the
      reflector<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46"
      class="fnanchor">[46]</a> of the diamond. This reflector is put
      beneath such diamonds as are so delicate as not to be able to stand
      a dark tint, such as would turn them black. If it happen that their
      delicacy is not great, and their water is good, it is customary to
      give them the tint under the step facets alone, and to combine the
      reflector with this, and the result is admirable.</p>

    <p>The reflector is made in this wise. You take a small piece of
      crystal glass, quite clean, and free from cracks or flaws. You cut
      it into a square of a size that shall fit into the bezel in which
      you propose to set your diamond; and you tint your bezel with the
      black tint of which we spoke above. Be careful to put the said
      reflector, the glass of which is tinted on the lower side only, in
      the bottom of the bezel, low enough to admit of the diamond standing
      over but not touching it, because if it does it will not reflect
      well.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47"
      class="fnanchor">[47]</a> This is how all the tenderest diamonds
      should be set, and beautiful they look, too. Beryls and white
      topazes and white sapphires, white amethysts, and citrine
      quartz,<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48"
      class="fnanchor">[48]</a> are all set in the bezel with a reflector
      of this kind, if they are of a sufficiently important size. It must
      be borne in mind that no stones but diamonds will stand a tint at
      the back, because they turn black, and lose their splendour. So much
      for the reflector.</p>

    <p>It is an extraordinary thing that the diamond, which is the most
      limpid and brilliant of all earthly stones, gains a thousand-fold in
      beauty when you, as it were, soil it with a black tint, while all
      other light stones, as soon as you touch them with a tint, lose
      their splendour, and turn black; forsooth this is owing to some
      occult power, some secret of nature in the diamond, which human
      imagination cannot penetrate. There are certain sapphires,
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>which the ingenuity of
      man can turn white, by putting them in a crucible in which gold is
      to be melted,<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49"
      class="fnanchor">[49]</a> and if not at the first heating, then at
      the second or third. Indeed your cunning gem-setter will always pick
      the palest sapphires, because, though they have the least colour,
      they are the hardest in substance. The same holds good of topazes,
      which are of similar hardness to sapphires, &amp; so may be
      classified with them. I propose here only to touch on these two
      stones in so far as they have kindred qualities to the
      diamond. There are few, then, however great their experience, when
      having before them the two stones could tell which of the two was
      the diamond, often being unable to distinguish them at first
      sight. The peculiar virtue of the diamond, however, admits of the
      trying of a simple experiment, by which you can at once distinguish
      one stone from another, and it is this. You take your tint &amp; rub
      both stones with it; your true diamond grows in brilliance &amp;
      beauty, the other becomes deadened and splendourless.  And this test
      suffices without trying the test of hardness too, but if you rubbed
      the two stones together you would soon find out the diamond.  Though
      the sapphire is so much harder than the ruby &amp; the emerald, it
      is a thousand times less so than the diamond. By the way, I need
      hardly mention that it would be absurd to test a polished gem by the
      above method.  That’s as much as I want to say about the
      diamond.</p>

      <h3 id="CHAPTER_XI_ABOUT_WHITE">CHAPTER XI. ABOUT
        WHITE RUBIES AND CARBUNCLES.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">I promised to tell you something about the finest
      sort of rubies, but before doing this, I want you to know something
      about another sort of ruby, called the white ruby. This stone is
      white by nature, not by any heating process like the other stones
      mentioned above, &amp; its whiteness may be likened to the
      chalcedony, the twin sister of the cornelian.  The latter has a sort
      of unpleasing livid pallor, &amp; for this reason is not used
      much.</p>

    <p>I have oft found many such in the bellies of wild fowl, so also the
      loveliest turquoises. I used to be very fond of going out
      shooting. I made my own powder, and became such a rare fine shot,
      that I should be ready to stand any test you like. I always shot
      with the simple ball, &amp; as for the powder, well, I’ll talk of
      that in its right place, but it was quite different from the powder
      commonly used. In this wise did I use to march over the Roman
      Campagna, at the time when the birds of passage return, and in their
      bellies I found stones of all sorts, turquoises, white &amp;
      coloured rubies, also emeralds, &amp; every now and again a
      pearl. But, as I said, these white rubies are of very little use;
      only you know them for rubies because of their great hardness.</p>

    <p>Of carbuncles: according to promise I’ll tell you of these, &amp;
      first of what I have seen with my own eyes. In the time of Pope
      Clement VII. there turned up a certain Raugeo, who was called Biagio
      di Bono. This man had a white carbuncle, similar to the white ruby
      mentioned above, but possessing so delightful a brilliance, that it
      shone in the dark, not so splendidly perhaps as the coloured
      carbuncles, but still so that when you put it into a very dark place
      it seemed as a glowing ember, and this did I see with my own
      eyes—but I must tell you in this connection an anecdote of a little
      old Roman gentleman—old, did I say?—nay, very old, for his grandson
      was one of my shop assistants. This man came often to my place,
      &amp; always had lots of pretty things to chat about. One fine day
      we fell a-talking about gems, and the old gentleman spake thus:
      ‘Once when I was a young man, I happed to be in the Piazza Colonna,
      and I saw one Jacopo Cola, a distant kinsman of mine, coming along;
      he was beaming all over, and he held out his closed fist to some
      friends who had been sitting on a bench hard by, and were just
      getting up. He spake thus to them: “What d’ye think, my friends?
      I’ve made a good day to-day, for I’ve found a little stone so
      beautiful that it is worth many scudi, and I found it in my
      vineyard, and I suppose it must have belonged to our ancestors,
      because as you know this vineyard lies beneath the great ruins
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span> familiar to all of
      you. Well, when I was coming home from work, &amp; had gone about
      200 yards, I was prompted to make water. As I was doing this and
      looking towards the vineyard, I fancied I saw a spark glowing at the
      foot of one of my vines; it seemed to me a perfect age before I
      could finish what I was about. When I did, I’m blessed if I could
      find anything, however hard I tried; so I thought I’d go back again
      &amp; have another look, and keep my eyes fixed upon it, so back I
      went the same way, and then all of a sudden out burst the spark
      again. Well, I kept looking &amp; looking at it, till, see here! I
      found this,”—so saying he opened his fist and showed his
      treasure. While he had been talking, a Venetian ambassador, who was
      coming along on his mule with a few servants, had stopped to
      listen. After a bit this gentleman came up close, as if he wanted to
      hear all about this wonder of a fire being transformed into a stone;
      then, very politely accosting my poor kinsman, “Gentlemen,” said he,
      “If I am not presuming upon you, or appear to be taking too great a
      liberty, might I beg of this gentleman to allow me to look at the
      beautiful stone that he says he found in his vineyard.” At these
      words Cola opened his fist, which he had kept locked up tight, &amp;
      said to the ambassador: “There he is, look at him as much as you
      like!” The Venetian gentleman, who was a man of perfect manners,
      continued with the politest language: “If I am not appearing too
      presumptuous,” he said, “I would make so bold as to ask if you, sir,
      are disposed to part with the stone, &amp; if so, at what you esteem
      its value?” The poor Roman, whose coat was somewhat frayed &amp; out
      at elbows—a fact which had given the Venetian pluck to drive his
      bargain—said: “Well, it isn’t exactly that I’ve got to sweat for my
      daily bread, but if you’re ready to pay the stone’s value, I don’t
      mind obliging you. Look at him well now, and see if you like him. I
      shall require ten ducats of the Camera for him.” The Venetian
      simpered satisfaction for a bit, &amp; then spake in the fashion of
      those polished gentlemen, much more polished than your Roman, who,
      though they are examples to the world in glory, are not up to your
      consummate Venetian in speech—they can’t
      <em>out</em> with it fast enough: “One favour only I beg of you; I
      never carry much money in my purse, may I entreat you to send the
      jewel to me by some trusty servant of yours, &amp; I will give him
      what you have asked.” The poor Roman, who knew no trustier friend
      than himself, said he would go along with him personally, and
      winking to one of his mates, to whom he had told all his adversity,
      he strode off with the ambassador, who dismounted &amp; walked
      beside him. Then the Venetian, in order to prevent the latter from
      repenting of his bargain, began chatting in the most delicious
      manner, in a manner such as only your Venetian can, &amp; enough to
      take any Roman’s breath away. The one listened, enjoying these
      exquisite nothings, the other prattled along as hard as he could,
      the journey really seeming an eternity to him. At length he reached
      his house, and
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span> putting his hand into
      a purse in which he had a great pile of ducats of the Camera, he
      spread them out with open hand before the astonished gaze of the
      poor Roman; the latter, who had gone many a long year without seeing
      the like of such, feasted his eyes on this delicious looking gold,
      &amp; then put the jewel in the ambassador’s hand. One, two, three,
      the latter counted out the ten ducats, shouted in haste to his
      servants that they should saddle his good horse, &amp; taking out
      two more ducats, called out to the Roman, who was just going off:
      “Here, I say, these two gold ducats I give you over &amp; above our
      bargain, to buy a rope to hang yourself with!” The proud Roman
      couldn’t make out why he was thus spoken to; he fired up, &amp;
      wanted to make for the ambassador, but our fine gentleman quickly
      mounted his horse, and sped away from Rome. Later on it transpired
      that he had had the jewel beautifully set, and gone off with it to
      Constantinople, where a new prince had ascended the throne. Owing to
      the rarity of the stone, he asked and received for it a fabulous
      sum, with which he afterwards betook himself again to Venice.’ That
      is all I ever heard of this kind of carbuncle.</p>

      <h3 id="CHAPTER_XII_MINUTERIE">CHAPTER
        XII. MINUTERIE WORK.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">Minuterie work is all that class of work done
      with the punch, such as rings and pendents and bracelets. In my
      time, too, it was the custom, among other charming things, to make
      little medals of gold which were worn in the hat or the cap; and on
      these medals portraits were engraved in low or half relief, and in
      the round, and they looked just lovely. The greatest master in this
      art that I ever knew, lived in the times of the Popes Leo, Adrian,
      and Clement, and he was Caradosso of whom I told you above. Now will
      I tell you not only of the method which he adopted in his craft, but
      that which was employed by other masters. It was Caradosso’s custom
      to make a little model in wax of the form he wished his work to
      be. When he had carefully finished the modelling of this and filled
      in all the undercutting, he made a cast of it in bronze of the
      proper thickness; then he beat out a gold leaf rather thicker, if
      anything, in the middle, and so as to admit of its being easily
      bent, and in surface some two knife backs bigger than the surface of
      the model.  This he proceeded to beat out into a slightly curved
      form, and to soften with heat, and then laid on to the bronze model,
      and with punches of the right sort,—wooden ones to begin with of
      birch or cornel,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50"
      class="fnanchor">[50]</a> the latter by preference—he very, very
      carefully followed the shape of his figure or whatever it was he was
      working on. Ever so much care is necessary while doing this to
      prevent the gold from splitting. And on you work, now with your
      wooden, now with your steel punches, sometimes from the back,
      sometimes from the front, ever most mindful to keep an equal
      thickness throughout, for if it become thicker in one place than in
      another, the work would not attain so fine a finish. It was just in
      this very getting of the gold so equal all over that I never knew a
      man to beat Caradosso. Well, then, when you’ve got your model worked
      up to the point of relief at which you want to bring it, you begin
      with the greatest cunning to bring the gold together over the legs
      and over the arms and round behind the heads of the figures &amp;
      the animals, then, if, when all has been well worked together, there
      is still a little bit of gold loose at the edges, you carefully cut
      it off with a pair of scissors. And the little bits that stick out
      at the back of the legs and arms and heads, that is to say those in
      high relief, are likewise ever so carefully beaten down. By the way,
      I ought to have told you that your gold must be good, gold of at
      least twenty-two-and-a-half carats, but not quite twenty-three carat
      gold, for you’d find that a bit too soft to work in; and if it were
      less than twenty-two-and-a-half it would be too hard, and rather
      dangerous to solder.</p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span></p>

    <p>And now for the soldering, if you’ve brought your work on so
      far. For this same hot soldering you take a little verdigris, the
      best you can get, from its original cake, nor must it ever have been
      used before, &amp; it should be about the size of a young hazel nut
      without its rind, with it you put the sixth part of salts of ammonia
      and as much borax; when these three substances are well-pounded
      together you dissolve them in a glass of clear water. Then with a
      soft wood shaving you take the mixture, which will now have the
      substance of a paint, and spread wherever there are joint lines on
      arms, legs, heads, or on the ground of your work. After this you
      pepper a little more well-pounded borax upon them out of your borax
      castor, and then light a fresh fire of partly consumed-wood coal and
      put your work in the fire. See that your coals are set with their
      unconsumed sides away from it as they are apt to smoke. This done,
      erect a little grating of coal on top of your work, minding,
      however, that the charcoal does not touch the work itself. Be ready
      at hand when the charcoal is beginning to glow and your work is
      growing fire-coloured, to blow wind over it with your bellows very
      skillfully and very evenly, so that the flames may play all round it
      alike. If you blow too hard the fire will spring up and burst into
      flame, and you run the risk of melting and spoiling your work.
      Watching with care you will see the outer skin of gold begin to glow
      and then to move; as soon as you note this, quickly take a brush and
      sprinkle a little water on your work, which will there and then be
      beautifully soldered without any need of special solder being
      applied to it. And this one might call the first firing.</p>

    <p>Indeed, the first soldering ought not to be called soldering at
      all, but rather firing in one piece, because there is so much virtue
      in the verdigris when combined with the salts of ammonia and the
      borax, that it only moves the outer skin of gold, and so
      fuses<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51"
      class="fnanchor">[51]</a> it together that it all grows to one even
      strength. After this you put your work into vinegar very strong and
      clean and mixed with a little salt, and in this you let it bide
      overnight. Next morning you find it bright and free of all
      borax.</p>

    <p>After this you put a little stucco at the back of it so that you
      can work on it with your punches; and this stucco you make of Greek
      pitch resin with a little yellow beeswax, together with a little
      brick dust or well-ground terra cotta; and this is the real right
      sort of stucco on which you may lay your medals, or any other
      similar work you may have to chase.  Then, as to your punches, you
      must have no end of these, from the broadest, getting smaller and
      smaller down to the very tiniest; and every one of these must have
      no sort or kind of cutting edge, because, you see, they are
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span> only to be used for
      the purpose of beating in and not of taking away; and this beating
      in you have to do ever so delicately.</p>

    <p>Now of a sooth shall you find that in the doing of this you will
      have made lots of little holes and rents, and these same have got to
      be soldered up. Not, mark you, in the way you did it before, but by
      the making of a special solder, and in this wise: You take six
      carats of pure and fine gold &amp; put with it one-and-a-half carats
      of fine silver and of fine copper, melting the gold first, and then
      putting the others to it, and so you have your solder, and with it
      you may make good all your holes and rents. Note further, that at
      every fresh soldering you must introduce a fresh alloy of silver and
      copper<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52"
      class="fnanchor">[52]</a> so as to prevent the solder of the time
      before from running together; and so on, too, in between each turn,
      out you take your work, press it on the stucco, &amp; chase over it
      with your punches until you have wrought it to such finish as you
      may desire. And then you have the whole fair method of the Master
      Caradosso of whom I told you before.</p>

    <p>Now I’ll tell you of another fine way of working employed by other
      able men who ran him pretty close. After the model in wax has been
      made and you have decided what it is you want to create, you take a
      sheet of gold, as I explained above, thin at the sides and thick in
      the centre, and you little by little beat it from the back with your
      larger punches until it is bossed up much like your model; by this
      means you don’t need to use your bronze,<a id="FNanchor_53"
      href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and you bring your
      work considerably forward before even in the other method the
      casting is done. In the former method, too, you will have had,
      before each re-joining, to rub your medal down with glass paper
      (such stuff as the glass makers sell) in order to clean from it most
      carefully whatever matters the fumes from the bronze may have
      sullied the gold withal. But if you follow my second method you
      won’t need to do this glass papering, because you won’t be bothered
      by the nasty stains the bronze makes on the gold.</p>

    <p>Whenever I can, while thus telling of my craft, I purpose giving
      you a practical example, which you know is always a much better way
      of explaining what a man means, &amp; which will make those of my
      readers who
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span> are eager to learn
      and to practise and delight themselves in these divers methods, much
      more likely to believe what they read. In the manner above described
      I once fashioned a medal for a certain <ins class="corr" 
      id="Girolano" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Girolamo">Girolano</ins> Maretta, a Sienese;
      and on this medal was a Hercules rending the jaws of the lion.  Both
      Hercules and lion had I wrought in such high relief that they only
      just touched the background by means of the tiniest attachments. The
      whole work had been done in the second of the above methods, that is
      to say without the bronze models; now working from in front, now
      from the reverse, and brought to such a height of delicacy and
      finish of design that our mighty Michael Angelo himself came to my
      very workshop to see it, &amp; when he had looked at it a minute or
      so, he, in order to encourage me, said: ‘If this work were made in
      great, whether of marble or of bronze, and fashioned with as
      exquisite design as this, it would astonish the world; and even in
      its present size it seems to me so beautiful that I do not think
      ever a goldsmith of the ancient world fashioned aught to come up to
      it!’ These words stiffened me up<a id="FNanchor_54"
                                         href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> just, and gave me the
      greatest longing to work, not only in the smaller things, but to try
      larger things also. For, thought I, words such as these, coming from
      so great a man, can but have the following meaning: Had the figures
      been tried on a large scale I should not have produced them with
      near such beauty as on a small; and while, on the one hand, the
      great man gave me so much praise, he, on the other, intimated that
      one who could do things in little of such merit might yet not be
      able to do them in great. But still, not so much because I imagined
      this to have been Michael Angelo’s meaning, as that I had heard that
      he had expressed it in words to others, these words of his inspired
      me with longing to learn yet a thousand times more than I knew
      already.</p>

    <p>This happened about a year after the sack of Rome; I was in
      Florence at the time. When I had made the medal, one of our
      Florentine gentlemen, by name Federigo Ginori, came &amp; looked me
      up. He was a great lover of beautiful things, and especially fond of
      men of talent, to whom he was a great patron. In former days he had
      been many years in Naples on business, &amp; there he had fallen in
      love with a great princess. On his return to Florence he bethought
      him of having a medal made, whereon to record this somewhat
      formidable attachment of his. So he came and found me out, and
      spake: ‘Benvenuto, my well-beloved, I have seen a little medal by
      your hand made for Girolano Maretta, and albeit I long to tell you
      that it is impossible for any medal to cap that one, yet for the
      love you bear me, make another for me, will you, if not more then at
      least as beautiful as that one; and in this medal I should like to
      see an Atlas with the heavens on his back; &amp; I should like it
      all so exquisitely
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span> done that it shall be
      recognised at once; &amp; pray don’t bother about any considerations
      of cost whatever.’ I set to work and made a little model with all
      the diligence I could, fashioning the Atlas in question out of white
      wax. Then, having said to the gentleman that he might leave the
      working out to me, I determined to make a medal that should have a
      field of lapis lazuli, the heavens a ball of crystal, &amp; engraven
      upon them the signs of the zodiac. So I made a plate of gold, and
      began, bit by bit to work my figure up in relief with all the
      patience you can possibly imagine.  I took a small rounded
      stake,<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55"
      class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and on this I wrought little by little,
      working up the gold from the ground with a small hammer, working
      right into arms and legs, &amp; making all alike of equal
      thickness. In this manner, &amp; with the greatest diligence and
      patience I brought the work to completion. This we call ‘lavorare in
      tondo,’ working in the round; that is without putting the figure on
      pitch, or such a stucco basis as I described above. It wasn’t till
      I’d worked it up to a certain point that I then took my punches and
      continued it on the stucco with very great finish. Then little by
      little did I raise the figure off its ground,<a id="FNanchor_56"
      href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> which is a thing very
      difficult to explain how to do—still I’ll tell you as best I
      can. Previously we saw how the arms &amp; legs of the figure might
      be worked as one and part of the gold background, and thus make it
      possible for the background to be utilised as a fitting part of the
      design. Now, however, since the background is not needed as a part
      of the design, it may be used up; therefore with a small hammer on
      your little stake or anvil, &amp; with the small end of the hammer
      you work gently on the gold, and with the action of the hand push
      the gold behind, using the punches as well, so that the figure comes
      up in high relief from the ground. In the other method where you
      left the figures on the ground, you didn’t want them in high relief,
      but took care that your fine ground never got out of line; now,
      however, since you have no use for it, you can twist it about at
      will, care only being taken that sufficient gold is left for the
      attachments at the back, and when all the background is cut away you
      can proceed to fix your figure on to whatever independent background
      you may have devised for it. After this you give it a last coating
      of solder to finish up with, but without however laying your work on
      the stucco, for the simple reason that there are now no more open
      places for the stucco to go in. This is how I did the Atlas, &amp;
      when I had finished him, I fixed him in those places where he was to
      touch the lapis lazuli background by means of fastening two little
      pins or stakes of gold, of sufficient strength, into holes made in
      the lapis, and so he was firmly set. Then I got a lovely crystal
      ball, of good proportion to my Atlas, engraved the zodiac thereon,
      and fixed it upon the nape of his neck, so that he held it high in
      his hands.
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span> To end all I made a
      most sumptuous frame adorned with gold, full of foliage, fruits, and
      other conceits, and set the whole of my work within it. Nor ought I
      to forget a very pretty sentiment that had to be added in the shape
      of a Latin motto. My gallant, inasmuch as he was enamoured of so
      great a lady, and of rank so much loftier than himself, wished me to
      place on the medal the words ‘<i lang="it">summam tulisse
        juvat</i>.’</p>

    <p>Some say that this gentleman died shortly after, though still quite
      in his youth, by reason of his love for the lady. As he had been a
      friend of Messer Luigi Alamanni, also a great lover of art, the
      latter at his death came into possession of the medal, &amp; he,
      while at a later time on a visit to the King of France, made a
      present of the medal to the King. Then began the King to make most
      earnest inquiry as to whether he knew the master who had made the
      medal. Messer Luigi declared that he did not know him personally,
      albeit he was all along my very dear friend. King Francis thereupon
      began to have a great longing that I should come &amp; enter his
      service, the which in the end I did. But of that I’ll tell later on,
      all in its proper place, because that didn’t happen till many years
      after.</p>

    <p>I promised to speak in good time of a clasp that I made for Pope
      Clement to fasten his cope with. Now since I can’t do your fine
      elegant manner of writing I’ll tell about my craft as clearly as I
      can, and as well as my simple mind will permit it, and best of all,
      I’ll give some more examples of things that happened to me—I shall
      be much safer if I do that.  This clasp was a very big and a very
      hard job; for, albeit a small piece of work, there is little doubt
      but that these small pieces of work are often harder the smaller
      they are. The clasp was about the size of an open palm and circular
      in form. Within it was a design of God the Father giving the
      benediction. The head and arms of the Father were worked completely
      in the round, the rest was raised in good relief out of the
      background, and was surrounded by a number of jolly little angels,
      &amp; of these some of them were peeping from out of His mantle,
      some were scattered about among jewels, of which I’ll tell you
      first. These angel babies were some of them done completely in the
      round, others in high relief, others again in bas-relief. And I so
      devised it that God the Father was seated on the big diamond, which
      had been bought it was said for 30,000 scudi. This suggests the
      reflection as to how much harder it is for a man to do a piece of
      work in which his design is limited by having to use special jewels
      or aught else in particular. Still for all that, you can do anything
      if only you set to work at it with all the love &amp; the zeal that
      your noble craft demands of you, and so did I, and this is how I did
      it.  I flattened out a sheet of gold about a finger’s width wider
      than my work was to be, having first made a very highly finished
      model of it. Then I
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span> began beating up the
      middle of the plate with my small hammers upon the stake; &amp; now
      working with the narrow end on the front, now on the back, I
      gradually bossed up the gold, using the punches in like manner, till
      the figure little by little took shape; &amp; so, little by little,
      first using one tool, &amp; then another, I gradually mastered the
      material, till one fine day God the Father stood forth in the round,
      most comely to behold.</p>

    <p>Pope Clement had got to hear that I worked in a method different
      from Caradosso, for certain envious men had told it to some of his
      suite, &amp; by reason of their evil tongues the holy father
      imagined that I was an ignoramus and not up to managing so big a
      job. So he sent for me to come and show him the method in which I
      worked, and how far I had got.  Straightway I went to him, bringing
      with me my work as far as it had got. God the Father stood out from
      it already &amp; showed very well how He was going to look when
      finished. For my part I thought that the work in the metal excelled
      that in the wax, and so thought his Holiness also; and being the
      sensible man that he was, he turned to certain gentlemen of his
      suite &amp; said: ‘Great is the virtue of
      determination,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57"
      class="fnanchor">[57]</a> the more she is troubled with envy the
      more beautiful doth she become, &amp; grows in despite thereof. I
      know but little of the technique of the work, but I am well assured
      that it is much more beautiful now than in the model I saw before:
      only I can’t for the life of me see how you are going to get that
      crowd of angels on to this disc without spoiling what you have done
      already.’ On this I described to the Pope the way in which I
      purposed to bring the angels to the fore, one by one, first those
      that were to be quite in the round, then those of less relief,
      working the gold up thick into the places where the highest relief
      was to be, in fact just as I had worked up God the Father, and
      employing hammers and punches alternately, now from in front, now
      from the back; and I showed him how the highest part of the relief
      was the hardest part of the work, and how the great art was to get
      the gold of as equal thickness as possible all over. Of course I
      know quite well that our good Master Caradosso worked in a different
      way, and indeed I learnt many goodly things from him; and for those
      who have learnt their craft, ’tis easy to put two and two
      together. But I’m of opinion that Caradosso’s method of working on
      the bronze model would have been much more difficult to employ in
      this instance, would have taken a much longer time, would have
      needed ever so many botchings and solderings, &amp; would have run
      all the risks of the fire into the bargain. Thus my experience was
      that by employing the other method you got rid of all these
      difficulties and had your work done much quicker.</p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span></p>

    <p>At these words of mine the good Pope, who was really an exceedingly
      capable man, said: ‘Go, my Benvenuto, work in your own way, finish
      it for me quickly, and it shall be well for you; and when, from time
      to time, I bid you come, bring your work with you; not that I may
      instruct you thereon, but that I may have the joy of beholding such
      goodly handiwork as yours.’</p>

    <p>The age of a good prince whose delight is in the encouragement of
      all beautiful things is the age for men of talent, and such a time
      came about in the days of the first Cosimo de Medici, who was their
      great patron. It was he who gave <ins class="corr" id="Filippo"
      title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Fillippo">Filippo</ins> Brunellesco, Donatello,
      &amp; Lorenzo Ghiberti their opportunity. Filippo was as fine an
      architect as ever was; Donatello sculped in marble and in bronze,
      &amp; even wrought wondrously in the difficult art of
      painting. Lorenzo Ghiberti made the bronze gates of S. Giovanni that
      have no equal in the world. Then came Lorenzo de Medici, under whom
      was developed Michael Angelo Buonaroti, most marvellous of men. He
      had scarce given proof as yet of his great powers when God willed
      that he should be called to Rome by Pope Julius II., who not only
      took pleasure in all that was beautiful, but also understood it, and
      so set Bramante, the architect, to work. Bramante, who, though a
      painter of little credit, had such a bent towards architecture in
      its grandest manner, that good Pope Julius, of his bountifulness,
      gave him lots of work and a salary of 1000 scudi a year to
      boot. Seeing how fond Pope Julius was of all kinds of beautiful
      work, and how he had a mind to have the inside of the Sistine Chapel
      painted, Bramante introduced Michael Angelo, who was then living in
      Rome almost unknown &amp; of little account. The work was entrusted
      to him, &amp; such goodly encouragement did he receive in the
      painting of that wonderful chapel that the grand manner of painting
      was as it were revived. Then came Pope Leo X., and at the same time
      Francis, King of France; and these twain ran it hard between them as
      to which should gather the greatest talent about him. Then came the
      luckless Pope Clement, and he helped and furthered the arts too,
      ’tis true, but he had so much adversity in his papacy, and there was
      so much trouble in the land, that he could never help as much as his
      kindly soul longed to do. I know well to tell of this for I served
      him during all his papacy, and was quite a young man at the
      time.</p>

    <p>It was in connection with the work of which I have been telling you
      above that the Pope said he wished to see the designs and models of
      all those who thought themselves able to undertake the work; and
      this was soon after the great sack of Rome, and I had come thither
      from Florence, and when I heard the rumour of it, I too made me a
      model in white wax of the size the work was to be, &amp; taking it
      with me presented myself before
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span> the Pope. Many
      artists were there showing the sketches they had prepared for this
      beautiful commission, &amp; when I joined them the Pope had already
      seen a goodly number, and they were set before his Holiness by one
      Micheletto, a stone-carver, an able man enough in his own line.  In
      all these divers designs their authors had so devised it that the
      big diamond was set in the middle of the breast of God the
      Father.<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58"
      class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The Pope himself had suggested the motive
      of the design, but when he saw how everybody alike had set so great
      a stone into the breast of so tiny a figure he said: ‘Why can’t that
      stone be set in some other manner except always in the breast?’
      Whereupon some of them replied that it could not be set otherwise if
      right value was to be given to it in the design. The Pope, who was
      beginning to weary of so many designs, turned to me and asked if I
      had brought nothing to show; while I was still undoing my box the
      Pope turned to some of the older masters, and said to them: ‘’Tis
      always well to look at everybody’s rendering of a thing: albeit
      Benvenuto is young, yet have I seen work of his that convinces me
      that he is in the right way.’ Then when I had uncovered my model
      &amp; put it before him; he had scarce seen it when he turned to me
      and cried out: ‘You’ve hit it!  that’s how I want it done!’ Then he
      turned to the others &amp; said: ‘See you now how this diamond can
      perfectly well be applied in another manner.  Mark how Benvenuto has
      made a stool of it and seated his figure thereon; a better way of
      rendering it I can’t conceive.’ Straightway he had me paid 500
      golden scudi, and with most courteous words bade me God speed to my
      work. And this was the beginning of such work as I—simple man as I
      am—have been enabled to do for the world.</p>

    <p>You remember I promised in the beginning of my book to tell the
      causes that inspired me to write it, causes which will move men to
      great wrath &amp; to great compassion for me. Well, I can’t keep it
      locked up in my breast any more, I must out with it! I have just
      told how great princes give opportunity to men of genius, &amp;
      cause to re-kindle through them the beautiful art of the past. Well,
      I make bold to say that Francis, King of France, was the greatest
      lover of genius &amp; the most open-handed of any man that ever
      lived in the world. I was called to his Majesty when I was in Rome,
      and I joined him in the year 1540, being just forty years of
      age. This king gave me all sorts of goodly work to do, the which I
      will describe all in their place, according as their various methods
      demand.</p>

    <p>During my time with his Majesty I made my first big works in
      sculpture and bronze, works of great size; never had I to ask him
      for pay or provision, but I just lived on his lordly liberality; for
      out of it he made me a
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span> stipend of 1000 scudi
      annually, &amp; gave me into the bargain a castle that is in Paris
      called ‘Petit Nello,’ wherein I served him four entire years.  And
      forasmuch as there was great war in these parts, I begged grace of
      his Majesty to let me travel to Italy; which favour he accorded me,
      though none too willingly. In the end I left with his good will, and
      remained his creditor for 700 ducats of gold of my salary, &amp; in
      addition all the stock and material for the great works I had been
      engaged on, the which amounted to about 15,000 scudi.</p>

    <p>In my castle,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59"
      class="fnanchor">[59]</a> which I left under the guard of my two
      pupils, Pagolo Romano and Ascanio Napoletano, I left several great
      and small vases made of my own silver, not to mention a large vase
      all embossed with figures.  This one I had made with the King’s
      silver, &amp; the others, as I have said, were made from my silver,
      &amp; therefore mine. And over and above all this I left behind all
      the flower of the studies of my twenty years in Rome, and all the
      rich furniture of my house, which was such as to be worthy of
      <ins class="corr" id="hosting"
      title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: hostting">hosting</ins> 
      any noble lord or gentleman. The Bishop of Paira, who was a
      friend of mine, did I thus entertain, and bring away from the hostel
      where he was staying, during a long sojourn in Paris; &amp; to many
      others too, in like manner, I gave abundant hospitality. I affirm
      that I came to Italy for no other purpose than to keep my six poor
      nephews, sons of my own sister; and I gave aid to all of them as
      soon as I was again among them. Before departing from Italy I went
      to seek out my lord the illustrious Duke Cosimo de Medici in order
      to pay him my respects, and ask his permission to return again to
      France. This amiable prince gave me as warm a greeting as could
      possibly be imagined, &amp; intreated of me to make him a model for
      a statue of Perseus with the head of Medusa in his hand, telling me
      that he wished to erect the statue under one of the arches in the
      great loggia of the Piazza. This raised a mighty zeal for glory
      within me, &amp; I said to myself: ‘So is a work of yours to stand
      between one of Michael Angelo &amp; one of Donatello, both of them
      men who surpassed the ancients in genius?  What greater treasure
      could I desire than the honour of being set between these two mighty
      men?’ And forasmuch as I knew that my studies in this art had by no
      means been slight, I promised myself that my work should hold its
      own beside theirs. In lightness of heart and full of energy I set me
      to a model of a Perseus about the height of a cubit, such as his
      excellency had <ins class="corr" id="commissioned"
      title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: comissioned">commissioned</ins>; and when I had done it I took it to
      him, and he marvelled at it &amp; said: ‘Benvenuto, if you had the
      courage to do this thing in great as admirably as you have done it
      in little, I trow for a certainty that it would be the loveliest
      work in the Piazza.’ These words moved me greatly, and in part with
      confidence for what I had already done, in part with great ambition
      for what I had still in mind to do, I said to the
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span> Duke, but with due
      modesty: ‘Most excellent sire, consider well that in this Piazza are
      works by Donatello and by Michael Angelo Buonaroti, perhaps the
      biggest men that ever were in the world; as for my own little model,
      I will undertake to turn out the work at least three times more
      beautiful than this model you see here.’</p>

    <figure class="figcenter illowp40" id="wax_perseus" >
      <img class="w100" src="images/i_p054a.jpg" alt="">
      <figcaption class="caption">A Wax Model for the Perseus</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>At these words of mine the duke shook his head, &amp; I took leave
      of him.  Two days after he set a room at my disposal, supplied it
      with material and all the appliances needful for doing the work, the
      which by slow degrees in a few years and after great difficulties
      needless here to relate, I completed in the state you now see
      it. The noble duke said to me in winning words that I had been
      better than my promise, and as I had contented him so well he was
      minded similarly to content me in whatever way I might wish. At this
      so charming speech from his Excellency I asked leave first before he
      accorded me aught for my labours, to be allowed to go on a
      pilgrimage to Vallombrosa, Camaldoli, Erma and S.  Francesco, in
      order to give thanks to God for having helped me through so many
      difficulties, all of which I will tell of in their place. At these
      words his Excellency was graciously pleased to let me go, and so I
      went on my way, giving thanks to God. In about six days I returned,
      and at once called upon my lord, who welcomed me again with the
      greatest favour. Two days later he seemed a bit grumpy without my
      having ever given him any cause for being so. When I asked him for
      leave of absence, he refused to grant it, and at the same time he
      gave me no more commissions, so that I could serve neither him nor
      other man. Nor was I able to find out the reason for the evil plight
      I was in. So in my despair I felt sure my bad luck was due to the
      influence of those heavenly powers who have dominance over us here
      below; &amp; in this state set to work to write my whole life, my
      origin, and all the deeds I had done in the world, and I also
      described the many years in which I had served the illustrious Duke
      Cosimo. But on thinking the matter over I was minded how great
      princes often take it ill if their subjects complain &amp; tell the
      truth about them; so with much heart-burning &amp; not without tears
      I tore up what I had written about the part of my life spent in Duke
      Cosimo’s service &amp; threw it into the fire, vowing that I would
      never write about it again.  But for the mere purpose of being of
      some use to the world, since I was thus left with nothing to do, and
      moreover prevented from doing aught, &amp; wishing to give God some
      sort of thanks for having made me the man I was, I set to write what
      I am now writing. Well, it’s off my mind now, so let us get back
      again to good Pope Clement, who gave me so many opportunities of
      doing great work, of all of which I will duly speak.</p>

    <p>A little more about the cope clasp, then. Having thus bossed up God
      the
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span> Father and wrought
      the whole thing in a manner different from Caradosso, I set myself
      afresh to fashion little by little the angels round about Him,
      especially those that were of higher relief than others. Everybody
      knows that this is one of the most difficult things to do in our
      craft, and likewise one of the most pleasing, for just think, I
      bossed up in high relief with my punches in the manner I described
      above, some fifteen little angels without ever having to solder the
      tiniest rent, and all this I was able to do because of my diligence,
      my knowledge, my patience, and my mastery over all the best methods
      of workmanship. The Pope would scarce let three days pass without
      sending for me, and each time would he see first one, then another
      angel baby peep forth, and this made him marvel greatly, and each
      time he asked me how on earth I managed to do it; &amp; how I could
      bring so difficult a piece of work about in so short a time, and all
      without a single rent.</p>

    <p>‘I have seen,’ said he,—and he was a man who knew a good thing when
      he saw it—‘many works of Caradosso which were full of holes and
      solder long before they had got as far as this.’ And thus each time
      he gave me good encouragement, &amp; I pegged merrily away at my
      work. When I had completed all the high relief angels and joined
      together the gold behind their heads and arms and legs, and filled
      up the openings, I began with great care the soldering, doing it in
      the way I described above, but putting with each new soldering a
      fresh alloy of the baser metals (<i>i.e.</i>, the copper &amp; the
      silver). Now forasmuch as I did not wish to disfigure so large a
      work with many solderings, and also because I wanted later on to
      enamel it, I put it to the fire as little as possible, managed to
      get all the legs and arms and heads together at one go, &amp;
      finished the lot in four firings. This done, I began with great
      diligence to work over the soldered parts, especially those on the
      background, till I had it all of uniform evenness, whereupon I set
      it once more on the pitch (<i>i.e.</i>, the stucco), &amp; once more
      wrought it over with the punches. A large number of angels in
      bas-relief, &amp; many in mere outline were still to do, so them I
      brought out boldly with the punches; upon this I melted the pitch
      out again, heated the gold well, &amp; applied it once more to the
      pitch, but this time with the under side of the work uppermost, so
      that all my figures were buried in the pitch; also this time made
      the pitch a bit softer because I was going to emboss from the back
      the figures which I had outlined in from the front; &amp; this I did
      with great skill, determining which I wanted to boss up most. Then
      once again I emptied out the pitch, and placed the work face upwards
      on the harder pitch, and most cunningly finished it all over with
      the punches as I described above. As there were still the gems to go
      upon it I made a base to the work, with an eye attached, so that it
      might therewith be applied to the cope on the Pope’s breast. This
      base was all worked around with
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span> different little
      snails and masks and other pleasing trifles, and was firmly fastened
      with invisible screws to the boss, and looked just as if it had been
      soldered on. As, moreover, the work was enamelled in various places,
      especially round the frame work, I set to to burnish it up to a fine
      finish on the bare &amp; unwrought parts, and this is how I did
      that: I took some four or five hard pointed
      stones<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60"
      class="fnanchor">[60]</a> which are sharp at the ends and thicken
      upwards in the manner and of the size of punches, and I used with
      them some well-powdered pumice stone. The object of using these
      stones is to take out the marks of the steel tools, the punches,
      chisels, files, and such-like, &amp; to give it a fine uniform
      surface; and last, but not least, a brilliancy of colour which would
      not be so easy if the marks of the steel tools (and the skin they
      make) were not obliterated. To finish the draperies also, I used a
      very fine steel tool exquisitely tempered and then broken off, for
      the broken end gives the right delicacy of
      texture;<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61"
      class="fnanchor">[61]</a> and I tapped it all over the draperies
      with a small hammer weighing about two scudi or less, &amp; this is
      what we call <i lang="it">camosciare</i>, tanning the surface.
      <a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> A
      further different method yet may be employed for larger drapery,
      &amp; this is called <i lang="it">granire</i>, graining, and is done
      by a sharp-pointed steel tool, but not broken like the other
      one. Then there is yet a further method by which the ground is
      sharply accentuated from the figures by hatching it over with a fine
      sharp graver <a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63"
      class="fnanchor">[63]</a> in one direction crosswise, for it does
      not turn well the other way. When all the above has been carefully
      carried out, put your work in a clean glass vase, &amp; get some
      little children to make water over it, for their urine is purer and
      warmer than men’s. Then prepare to give it its last finishing
      touches by colouring.  This you do with verdigris &amp; salts of
      ammonia; the verdigris must be as pure as possible; and if you want
      it firm and richly coloured add a twentieth part of clean saltpetre,
      the stuff they make gunpowder with. These must all be well ground
      together, but mind you don’t grind them upon iron or bronze, they
      must be pounded on stone and with stone; porphyry is the best stone
      of all. You then take the powder you have made from the above, put
      it in a glass flask, and mixing it with a strong white vinegar, make
      a paste of it not too moist nor too dry, and apply this paste to
      your work with as fine a hog sable as you can find, putting it on
      very evenly and to about the thickness of half a knife’s back. At
      the same time you must have ready a wood-coal fire half-burnt out,
      spread the coals so that you can lay your work upon them, put it in
      the fire &amp; with your pinchers take a few glowing coals and move
      them up and down over the paste, especially where it is thickest, so
      that it heats equally all over. You must be careful not to do this
      for too long, there’s all the difference between heating
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span> &amp; scorching your
      work, and if you did this it would get a bad colour on the one hand,
      &amp; on the other be difficult to clean afterward. When you see the
      paste drying equally and about half-dry, put your work on to a
      stone, or on a wooden table; and cover it up with a clean basin till
      it has got cold. Then put it again into a glass jar, and if you want
      it to come out well, let the little ones make water over it again as
      before. After this clean it up with small soft hog sables. This
      injunction need only be observed in cases where the work is
      enamelled, in other cases it will do just to dip it in urine after
      the heating of the paste of verdigris. After this the precious gems
      are set firmly with screws and clamps, and last of all the base is,
      as I told you before, firmly screwed on.</p>

    <p>Yet another way there is of working upon gold, particularly in
      cases where you want to introduce figures of about half a cubit in
      size. Pursuing my method of always making things clear to you by
      means of examples, I mind me of many of the cardinals in Rome who
      used to have crucifixes in their private cabinets; these crucifixes
      were about the height of a palm or a finger more, &amp; were made of
      gold, silver and ivory. The first of these gold crucifixes was made
      by Master Caradosso, and most admirably designed, and I suppose he
      got about 100 scudi apiece for them, or more.  First I’ll tell you
      the way he made his, then I’ll tell you how I made mine, which
      differed considerably from his method, &amp; was much harder, but
      was sooner finished, and produced more beautiful results. It was in
      this wise: Caradosso would make a little model in wax of the size he
      wished his work to be, but he made the legs apart, &amp; not as is
      customary with the Crucified, one crossed over the other. Then he
      cast his model in bronze; and cutting his gold sheet in triangular
      form some two or three large fingers wider all round than would
      cover his model, he laid it thereon and hammered it over with rather
      long wooden hammers till it looked like a half relief; next he
      proceeded very carefully to work it all over front and back with
      punches &amp; hammers till the relief stood out to his liking; then,
      still with the same tools, he joined the ends of gold together at
      the figure’s back until they touched on the round of the head, back,
      and the legs. After this he filled the figure with
      pitch, <i>i.e.</i>, the aforesaid stucco, and with punches and
      hammers brought out<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64"
      class="fnanchor">[64]</a> all the muscles and limbs. Then he emptied
      the pitch out again, joined &amp; soldered the gold together, using
      gold of two carats less than the gold of his figure, leaving one
      hole still open at the shoulder to admit of the pitch being again
      poured in and out; and then wrought it over once more with his
      punches; very carefully placed the feet crosswise, and then gave it
      its last coating and finish. I don’t employ this bronze method
      because I don’t think bronze &amp; gold go well
      together, <span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">[59]</span>the bronze
      tending to crack the gold, and the whole thing taking a long time in
      the execution. Owing to my experience and my all round knowledge of
      the craft, I went straight to the gold with my punches and a number
      of small stakes called <i lang="it">caccianfuori</i>; and so, while
      Caradosso was still fiddling away with his bronze casting, I had got
      several days’ work ahead of him, and was quit of the bother of the
      bronze firings into the bargain; and thus, though in other respects
      I followed all the methods of this excellent man, also in enamelling
      and in colouring, it came about that I did much more and obtained
      much better results than he.</p>

      <figcaption class="caption">King Francis’ Salt, first
        view</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Now my friend, in order to keep my promise with you as to the real
      practical things, and to show you that I’m not one who goes cribbing
      other people’s ideas &amp; methods but has worked them out with his
      own hands, I’ll tell you of the salt cellar<a id="FNanchor_65"
      href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> I made for King
      Francis I. It was oval in shape and about two-thirds of a cubit
      round, and the base of it was about four man’s fingers high, and
      very richly ornamented. And I divided it up in such pleasing wise as
      one’s craft will allow; one part I made as ocean and the other as
      earth, and on the side of ocean I had put a figure of gold about
      half a cubit high, completely rounded &amp; made with punches and
      chisels, in the manner told above. Ocean was personified by Neptune,
      God of the Sea, and I made him in a shell, a kind of nautical
      triumphal car to which were yoked four sea-horses—horses’ heads and
      fishes’ tails.  In Neptune’s right hand I put his trident, while his
      left was stretched out the whole length of his arm. Over a most
      richly wrought bark which was meant to hold the salt, were graven
      most minutely and cunningly battles of marine monsters; on the
      opposite side to Neptune was a female figure, of the same size as
      the male, and I so devised it that the legs of the male &amp; the
      female were crossed most gracefully one with the other, and in each
      the one leg was bent and the other extended, thus typifying the
      mountains &amp; the even places of the earth. By the side of the
      female figure I put a little Ionic temple, most richly wrought, and
      this was to hold the pepper; in her right hand was a very elaborate
      cornucopia of leaves and fruit and flowers, and on the earth where
      she sat I indicated a number of beautiful little beasties, just as
      on the other side I had fashioned a variety of exquisite little fish
      peeping up from the sea. Furthermore, in the oval body of the salt I
      had planned out eight niches, in each one of which figured Spring,
      Summer, Autumn &amp; Winter, on one side, and Dawn, Day, Twilight
      and Night on the other. In the hollow of the salt’s base was a block
      of ebony, of which, however, only a tiny strip showed beneath, and
      the which, being black, told well against the gold.  This base again
      rested on four balls of ivory, set half way into the ebony
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span> and so devised that
      they turned on their pivots, and you could move the salt cellar
      about hither and thither on the table, &amp; roll it where you
      liked.  I must tell you some absurd things that happened to me when
      I presented the salt to the most Christian King. His Majesty had
      referred me to one of his treasurers, a Monsieur de Marmagna, a
      shrewd old fellow, and terribly fierce. Now you know the French
      &amp; the Italians are deadly enemies; well, this old gentleman,
      about a month before I brought the salt-cellar to the King, had
      shown me a little bronze statuette a trifle bigger than my gold
      ones. This figure was an Antique, &amp; represented Mercury with his
      caduceus in his hand. He told me that it belonged to a poor peasant
      who would gladly sell it, whereupon I said that if he did not care
      to buy it for himself, I, who knew the figure to be of very charming
      workmanship, would willingly give 100 golden scudi for it, and like
      the frank and open man I am, I praised the figure greatly, declaring
      I had never seen a lovelier. Whereupon that evil old man said he
      would do his best to get it for me, and gave me great hopes of
      getting it, for that I had set it at a higher value, &amp; offered
      more than any other connoisseurs who had seen it. I thought no more
      about the matter till the day that I brought my salt-cellar to King
      Francis. The good King examined my work very carefully, and
      expressed himself most satisfied, when, just as all were expressing
      their delight, that wicked old fellow drew forth his statuette &amp;
      said to the King: ‘Sacred Majesty, this figure is an Antique, as you
      may readily see; and ’tis of so excellent workmanship that Benvenuto
      here has himself offered 100 golden scudi for it. I had it brought
      among my baggage from Languedoc at the time of my treasurership; but
      courage failed me to present it to your Majesty until I had
      satisfied myself that it was of sufficient excellence to merit your
      acceptance.’</p>

      <figcaption class="caption">King Francis’ Salt, second
        view</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>At these words the King turned to me, and, in the old boy’s
      presence, asked if what he had said was true. I replied: Most
      assuredly, and that the work appeared to me admirable. Whereupon the
      King said: ‘Then God be praised that here in our own day there be
      yet men born who can turn out so much more beautiful things than the
      ancients.’</p>

    <p>Therewith he smiled, and gave old M. de Marmagna back his
      statuette, for of course he saw that the intention had been to
      disparage my work beside the antique. Hundreds of most graceful
      &amp; complimentary things did he continue to say about my work, so
      much so that I never wished for any better remuneration for it than
      I got that day.</p>

      <h3 id="CHAPTER_XIII_ON_CARDINALS">CHAPTER XIII. ON
        CARDINALS’ SEALS.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">This sort of work is delightful. In my time in
      Rome, that was about 1525, there was a certain master from Perugia,
      called Lautizio, who practised nothing else but the making of seals
      for the bulls of cardinals. These seals are about the size of a
      ten-year-old child’s hand, and they are made in the shape of an
      almond. The cardinal’s title is engraved on them, and usually in the
      form of a rebus, or allegorically.  Lautizio used to get at least
      100 scudi for each seal he made. Now always sticking to my method of
      describing things from work I have done with my own hands, I’ll tell
      you of two that I made in this branch of my art.</p>

    <p>The first was for the Cardinal of Mantua, brother of the Duke. On
      it was engraved the ascension of our Lady, with the Twelve Apostles,
      for so ran the Cardinal’s title. The other seal, much more richly
      figured, was for the Cardinal Ippolito of Ferrara, brother of Duke
      Hercules. On this one was engraved St. Ambrose on horseback, with a
      whip in his hand chastising the Arians. And as two stories had to be
      wrought upon it, for the Cardinal had a twofold title, it was
      divided down the middle and the legend of St. John the Baptist
      preaching in the desert was engraved on the other part, and both
      subjects were wrought with figures.  For the Mantua seal I got 200
      ducats, for the Ferrara one, 300.</p>

    <p>The seals are made in the following manner. You take a smooth and
      polished black stone, and draw thereon the design you want to appear
      on the seal; and with black wax, a bit hardened, you fashion
      whatever relief you wish the seal ultimately to impress. When this
      is very delicately accomplished, you take a little volterrano
      gesso,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66"
      class="fnanchor">[66]</a> or any other gesso, provided it be very
      fine—boiled gesso it should be—&amp; after having moistened your wax
      by painting it over very lightly with a fine paint brush and a
      little clean and pure olive oil, you put the gesso on your wax. You
      must mind not to get too much oil on your wax, for it would then
      hurt the gesso and prevent it from penetrating into the finer
      delicacies of the wax. Before pouring on your gesso in the liquid
      state, you must make a little wall or embankment of fresh clean
      clay, about two fingers high, all round your seal. As you pour your
      gesso on, you guide it about very carefully into all the interstices
      of the wax by means of a long-haired brush.<a id="FNanchor_67"
      href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span> After the gesso is
      well set, remove it from the wax. This, of course, will be easily
      done, as there is no undercutting, for since the work is ultimately
      to serve the purpose of a seal, no projections are permissible. Then
      you clean out the matrix with a knife, removing any scum or spoiled
      surface that may have been made by the gesso on the inside, and
      polish it all up all round.</p>

    <p>Now there are two ways of casting in silver, both of them are good
      and both of them will I describe to you. ’Tis true that one is a
      little easier than the other, but as I say, both are good and you
      may adopt whichever most wins your fancy. Do not, however, fail to
      try both, because it is good for you to learn them, &amp; you will
      find them very helpful to you in many ways in other branches of the
      goldsmith’s art. The first method was the one employed by Lautanzio,
      and he, as I said, was the greatest master in this branch of work
      whom I ever knew. He used to take what is called earth for founding
      in boxes,<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68"
      class="fnanchor">[68]</a> the same that all the bronze founders use,
      and from which they cast the harness of horses &amp; mules, brass
      studs, and such-like trappings. And forasmuch as this clay is known
      all the world over, I shan’t bother about describing it, but only
      say that it is a kind of tufa earth. By the bye, as I write I am
      minded of a very rare kind of this tufa which is found in the bed of
      the Seine in Paris. While there I used to take what I wanted from
      hard by the Sainte Chapelle, which stands on an island in Paris in
      the middle of the Seine. It is very soft, and has the property,
      quite different from other clays used for moulding purposes, of not
      needing to be dried, but when you have made from it the shape you
      want, you can pour into it while it is still moist, your gold,
      silver, brass, or any other metal. This is a very rare thing, and I
      have never heard of it <ins class="corr" id="occurring"
      title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: occuring">occurring</ins>
      anywhere else in the world.</p>

    <p>Before considering the other kinds of clay that may be used for
      this sort of work, it will be best for me to tell you carefully how
      to make your gesso model for casting your seal from. After it is
      well cleaned with the knife in the way above described, powder it
      with a little fine charcoal-dust, or smoke it over with the soot
      from your lamp or taper; either will do, and I really needn’t
      describe this, because everybody knows how to do it. Then press the
      model into a caster’s sand-box of sufficient size to hold it
      conveniently.</p>

    <p>This done, dry well that portion of the mould where the figures
      come (that is to say if you are using the Italian, not the Paris
      clay), then have
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span> ready a little
      dough<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69"
      class="fnanchor">[69]</a> in the form of a cake similar in shape
      &amp; thickness to what your silver or metal seal is finally to be,
      and put this over the figures formed by the gesso and which will
      appear in relief, having previously smoked over the mould with a
      little candle-smoke. This done, take the second box, fill it with
      the same moist earth and when dried set it upon the first. Mind in
      so doing that you do not disturb the part already dried where the
      figures are.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70"
      class="fnanchor">[70]</a> This second half you will easily mould.
      Then open the mould, and after taking out the dough-cake, make the
      mouths and the two vent holes, beginning at the bottom and going up
      as high as the mouth or ingress hole. When both parts are dry, smoke
      them over with a little candle-smoke and let them cool, have your
      silver well molten and then pour it in. Experience shows that it is
      better to pour the silver into cold than into hot matrices.</p>

    <p>Now, for the second method, differing considerably from the first,
      but, as I have employed both, and the second not only for seals but
      for casting all sorts of other things too, I’ll describe it to you
      also. When you have from your original wax cast a gesso matrix in
      the manner above described, take a little of the same gesso, mix
      with it a little pith of horn<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71"
      class="fnanchor">[71]</a> well dried, a further part of
      tripoli,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72"
      class="fnanchor">[72]</a> &amp; finally another part of
      well-powdered pumice stone, and pound these four parts well up
      together. Then add as much water to them as shall give them the
      consistency of a paste—neither too thick nor too fluid. Then with a
      fine brush paint the surface of your seal all round over the wax
      projections and into the interstices, with a little olive
      oil. Waiting till it is well dried in the way we Florentines call
      <i lang="it">verdemezzo</i>, that is to say neither too dry nor too
      moist,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73"
      class="fnanchor">[73]</a> make a little wall of clay about two
      fingers high all round it, and pour the above mixture into the work
      and paint it well in and around the whole of your subject.  Pile the
      mixture up at least two fingers high and make about four fingers
      more of it at the upper end on account of the almond form which is
      the shape your seal will be, for you need there greater size for the
      pouring-in mouth of your silver or whatever metal you may be
      using. When the
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span> gesso is thoroughly
      dried, which will not be till some four hours or so, separate the
      one piece of gesso from the other, taking very great care that none
      of your design is injured. As you may well imagine, it was much
      easier to separate the matrix from the wax in the first method than
      from the composition in the second, because in the former it had a
      firmer consistency.  If some of the arms and heads don’t appear to
      you to come out quite a success, and remain stuck in the matrix, you
      can remedy that in either of the following ways. You can either pick
      out the bits remaining in the mould with a small paint brush, &amp;
      re-apply them with a little powdered tripoli, and since your design
      is in relief you will easily see the impressions made by it in the
      mould. Or, for the other way, you can clean out the mould entirely,
      paint it round again and fill it up with the composition in the same
      way as before; often if the first turn has not come out well, the
      second does.</p>

    <p>But pay the greatest possible attention to what I am going to tell
      you now.  Make a waxen form, almond-shaped, and of the exact size
      your seal is to be, hollow it out, and lay it over the surface of
      your gesso relief. Then make your little ramparts of earth about
      this wax, taking heed to make due provision for the channel of the
      casting, which should be of ample length; &amp; here I ought to tell
      you that the longer your channel is the better chance your work has
      of turning out well. There are no end of little details still to be
      observed, but if I were to tell you all of them I might as well
      begin teaching you your A B C. So I assume that my readers are
      people who have mastered the first principles of the Art. I would
      remind you, too, that both the ingress mouth &amp; the vents have to
      be made of wax &amp; applied to the wax core. These vents are fixed
      below, &amp; turn up around the seal towards the ingress mouth; they
      must not, however, come in contact with the latter, because they
      have to do their own work of drawing out the air.<a id="FNanchor_74"
      href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span></p>

    <p>This done, bind up your seal with well-tempered iron or copper
      wire, and let it bide in the sun, or some place where it can get
      warm &amp; well dried.  Then put it in your little furnace of tiles
      and iron hoops and melt out the wax with such heat as may be
      needful. Of course your wax must have been free from all impurities
      or it would never melt out properly. And when you have melted it out
      you make the fire stronger till your mould is regularly burnt, &amp;
      the more it is baked the better your work will be. Then let it cool,
      and because the silver adapts<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75"
      class="fnanchor">[75]</a> itself more readily to the cold than to
      the hot mould—cold, mark you, but not moist—when it is well molten
      pour it in. But ere you do this, in order that it may not
      burn,<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76"
      class="fnanchor">[76]</a> strew a little borax over it and upon that
      a handful of well ground tartar,<a id="FNanchor_77"
      href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> and you will find this
      help your work wonderfully. Then dip the mould in water in order
      better to separate it from the silver, and so break it open.  This
      done clean the silver off at the points where the channel &amp; the
      vent holes come, and give it a subtle finish with the file. After
      this, in order to give the seal its final touches, you place it on
      the pitch, and, with your first gesso matrix before you, work the
      silver with your punches, gravers and chisels, touching up and
      completing your subject now here, now there, figures, swags, arms,
      bodies, legs, all alike, accentuating<a id="FNanchor_78"
      href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> them in the matrix
      with your steel tools. To see better how you are getting on, you may
      occasionally press in a little black wax, or whatever colour pleases
      you better, to gauge the projections. Now note this: my custom was
      to cut out the heads, hands and feet of my figures on small steel
      punches, and thinking the work came clearer and got a better result,
      I struck these punches with dexterous strokes upon the seal with a
      hammer into their different places. Also you should make in a
      similar manner an alphabet of steel punches, likewise many other
      conceits according as taste prompts.  When I was in Rome, or
      elsewhere, working in this line, I ofttimes amused myself by making
      new alphabets, each for its occasion, for they wear out soon, and I
      got much credit by my inventiveness. Your letters should be well
      formed, &amp; shaped as a broadly cut pen might shape them; the
      strokes going up or down with the action of the hand, the letters
      being neither too fat and stumpy, nor too long and thin, for both
      these are unpleasing to behold, the moderately slim ones are the
      nicest to look at.</p>

    <p>I ought not to omit telling you that the cardinal’s arms, or
      whatever they may be, have to be done on the seals; and these are
      always richly ornamented with figure work, and I often used to have
      for the handle where-with the seal was attached, some fine beasts,
      or as often figures, according to the emblem of the gentleman for
      whom the seal was made. You should
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span> be careful not to
      omit these little complimentary touches because they redound to the
      honour of the master &amp; please the patron whom he serves.  I
      made, among others, such a handle in gold for the Duke of Mantua
      after I had made the one for his brother the Cardinal; and in
      addition to all the care I had put into the seal itself, I added a
      little Hercules for the handle, &amp; he was sitting on his lion’s
      skin, and had his club in hand. For this tiny figure I made no end
      of studies, &amp; it brought me much honour with the sculptors and
      painters, and among these was Master Giulio Romano; some of them
      made use of the design, too, for other purposes, and I was well paid
      for it.</p>

    <p>Some artists have gone straight to work at their seals with merely
      cutting directly into their silver, and without casting at all, but
      pluckily doing their design straight on in the reverse with genuine
      knowledge of their art, and using the steel dies of which I told
      you, and they succeeded in it, too. I also have done this, but I
      have found the casting method more practicable; though both are
      good, and can lead to excellent results.</p>

      <h3 id="CHAPTER_XIV_HOW_TO_MAKE">CHAPTER XIV. HOW TO
        MAKE STEEL DIES FOR STAMPING COINS.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">Since the art of the coiner can teach the
      elements of stamping medals in methods similar to those of the
      ancients, we will treat of that art first. You must bear in mind
      that the ancients, though they made their coins for use, undoubtedly
      made their medals for show; and as regards the former, we moderns
      may pride ourselves on being able to produce them with greater
      facility, and that, like the printing of books and many such-like
      arts, is a discovery of ours, which though it be out of my scope to
      speak of them here, I may have occasion to touch on elsewhere.  As
      to the coins, I shall, according to my usual custom, speak with
      actual instances of the methods I have myself wrought in. The first
      coins I made were for Pope Clement VII. in Rome, who summoned me to
      come to him from Florence some eighteen months after the great sack
      of Rome by the Lord of Bourbon. And since the house of Medici was at
      that time expelled from Florence, the Pope sent for me by the hand
      of Master Jacopo dello Sciorina,<a id="FNanchor_79"
      href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> the same that kept the
      ferry across the Tiber, by the Banchi in Tresteveri not far from the
      palace of Messer Agostino Chigi. This Master Jacopo wrote me twice
      on the Pope’s account; when I got the second letter, I made off as
      fast as I could, for of a truth those terrible
      radicals<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80"
      class="fnanchor">[80]</a> in power then would have hanged me had
      they found it on me. Pope Clement, when I came, treated me with the
      most winning kindnesses, and ordered me to make the coins for his
      city and Mint in Rome. The first coins I made were gold pieces,
      worth about two ducats each, on which were stamped figures of divers
      sort. On the one was the form of a nude Christ, his hands bound
      behind him, done with all the care and study I was capable of; down
      the sides of the figure ran the legend ‘<i lang="it">Ecce Homo</i>,’
      and around the circumference the words ‘<i lang="it">Clemens VII.,
        Pont. Max.</i>’, while on the other side was stamped the head of the
      Pope.</p>

    <p>A new occasion soon offered itself. Though I don’t want to write a
      chronicle of events, &amp; though I was not directly affected by
      them, I can’t help touching upon them slightly. What the current
      talk in Rome was at the time, I don’t need to dwell on; any man with
      a head on his shoulders may easily imagine that for himself. The
      second coin, a beauty, was likewise of gold, &amp; a two-ducat
      piece. On one side was a pope in his pontifical robes, &amp; an
      emperor also in his regalia; the two were supporting a cross which
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span> was in the act of
      falling to the ground. I forget if there was a legend on this side;
      but on the other were a St. Paul and a St. Peter in more than half
      relief, with this legend around them: ‘<i lang="it">Vnus spiritus,
        una fides erat in Eis.</i>’ This coin brought me much honour, for I
      put great labour into it.  As the Pope put more gold into it than
      its value warranted, it soon was melted down again.</p>

    <p>A third coin of my making was in silver, of the value of two
      carlins, on the one side of which was the head of the Pope, and on
      the other side a St. Peter, just the moment after he has plunged
      into the sea at the call of Christ, and Christ stretches out his
      hand to him in most pleasing wise, and the legend to this was
      ‘<i lang="it">Quare dubitasti?</i>’</p>

    <p>In Florence likewise did I make all the moneys for Duke Alexander
      the first of that name; they were 40 soldi pieces. And because the
      Duke was curly headed, the people called these coins the Duke’s
      curls.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81"
      class="fnanchor">[81]</a> On one side was his head, and on the other
      St. Cosmo and St. Damian. In like manner did I make the coins
      called <i lang="it">barile</i> and <i lang="it">grossone</i>.</p>

    <p>As I said above, the ancients had not the facilities for stamping
      coins we have, &amp; therefore we never see any of the beautiful
      sort,<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82"
      class="fnanchor">[82]</a> for coins should be made, or rather their
      dies, with the purpose of striking with the greatest ease. To begin
      with, two steel tools are needed, one called
      the <i lang="it">pila</i> the other
      the <i lang="it">torsello</i>. The <i lang="it">pila</i> is in the
      form of a small stake or anvil, upon which the medal you wish to
      press is cut in intaglio. The other tool,
      the <i lang="it">torsello</i>, is about five fingers high, its face
      being the size of your coin, and it gradually tapers off toward the
      end. Both <i lang="it">pila</i> &amp; <i lang="it">torsello</i> are
      made of carefully chosen iron, with their heads covered in the
      finest steel about one finger thick. With his file the master gives
      them whatever shape &amp; size his coin may need. Then he makes a
      concoction of earth, powdered glass, soot from the chimney, and bole
      of Armenia,<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83"
      class="fnanchor">[83]</a> adds a little horse-dung to this, mixes it
      all up into a paste with a man’s urine, &amp; puts it on to the ends
      of the <i lang="it">pila</i> and the <i lang="it">torsello</i> to
      the thickness of about a finger.  These he then puts into the fire,
      which should be strong enough to raise them to bright
      redness;<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84"
      class="fnanchor">[84]</a> keeping the fire up for, say, a good
      winter’s night, he then lets them cool down by allowing the fire to
      go out.<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85"
      class="fnanchor">[85]</a> The exact size of the coins is now given
      to the ends of the dies, barring about
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span> half the thickness of
      a knife’s back all round the circumference, and the face of each is
      then ground on a soft, polished stone until
      both <i lang="it">pila</i> and
      <i lang="it">torsello</i> are absolutely smooth. Then with the
      compasses the exact size of the coin is drawn upon them, &amp; also
      with another pair of compasses the circumference of the letters that
      form the legend round is marked. In order that these compasses
      should not shift about, a pair should be specially made of thick
      steel wire and of the exact size needed. It is best to have at least
      two pairs of each kind, and also one pair that will open and shut as
      you please. When this is done, the <i lang="it">pila</i> is firmly
      set in a big lump of lead of at least 100 lbs. in weight. After this
      you can proceed to the engraving<a id="FNanchor_86"
      href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> of your coin on the
      die.</p>

    <figure class="figcenter illowp60" id="coins" >
      <img class="w100" src="images/i_p068a.jpg" alt="">
      <figcaption class="caption">Coins and Medals from various
        collections</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>You very carefully cut upon the finest steel your
      design, <i>e.g.</i>, the head of whatever prince you are serving,
      and in order to do this nicely you must first have your steel well
      softened in the fire in the way I showed you the
      <i lang="it">pila</i> &amp; <i lang="it">torsello</i> were; only
      take heed that your tool is of the very finest steel.  And the tools
      with which you work have to be made specially for the purpose.  Thus
      for a head I should make the tool in two pieces, and for the various
      figures on the reverse of a coin I should use a number of different
      pieces according to my discretion. Some have worked with very few,
      but in so doing have much greater difficulty in sinking the design
      into the die.  The more such pieces you have, the easier it becomes;
      but you must always give great care in the combination of your
      punches. And this combining is done while the master is engaged in
      cutting the intaglios by taking frequent impressions on a piece of
      polished tin, to which you can give the right circumference with
      your compasses, until you get the results you wish.</p>

    <p>The tools used for this purpose have two names, in some instances
      they are called <i lang="it">punzoni</i> (punches), and in other
      cases <i lang="it">madre</i> (matrices), and of a truth they are the
      mothers that may be said to beget the figures and all the other
      things you fashion in the die of your coins.<a id="FNanchor_87"
      href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> The men who did the
      best work in coining always did the whole of the work upon either
      the punches or the matrices, and never once touched up the dies with
      either gravers or chisels, for that would be a great blunder, as all
      the various dies necessary for making many impressions of the same
      coins, would be a bit different, and thus cause slight differences
      in the coins themselves, and that would be making things easy for
      forgers, whereas coins well wrought in the way above described could
      be less easily copied. But I must return to you, dear reader, where
      I left off above, with the <i lang="it">pila</i> stuck in the
      lead.</p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span></p>

    <p>Take your <i lang="it">madre</i> or punches, and since it almost
      always is a prince’s head that is cut into
      the <i lang="it">pila</i>, set to with the first piece of your
      combination, and, fitting each into its place, strike it a blow with
      the hammer, and lift hand and tool up as smartly and rapidly as you
      brought them down, for if the <i lang="it">madre</i> shift, even but
      ever so slightly, it will tend to blurr your work.  In like manner
      add the limbs and the heads of your figures in such wise as your
      craft and your experience shall teach you, and so on similarly any
      other things, coats of arms, devices, beautiful alphabets, the
      beading for the coins’ border, till all are well fashioned in
      both <i lang="it">pila</i> and <i lang="it">torsello</i>. And since
      I should omit nothing for your better guidance, know that the hammer
      needful for stamping in the larger <i lang="it">madre</i>, such for
      instance as a head would need, ought to weigh about 4 lbs., while
      those requisite for the smaller punches may weigh less; those for
      the smallest of all—for the beading for instance—may be very
      tiny—each according!</p>

    <p>When the sinking by both <i lang="it">pila</i>
      and <i lang="it">torsello</i> is completed, set to and file off the
      superfluous margin right up to your border of beading. See that it
      is strongly blunted<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88"
      class="fnanchor">[88]</a> where you have filed it towards the
      beading, for without this your die would spoil and quickly perish,
      but where it is blunted it will not spoil. Then set to and temper
      your steel;<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89"
      class="fnanchor">[89]</a> to this end you heat it, and let it glow,
      neither too much nor too little, but just sufficient to temper it
      aright. And forasmuch as in the tempering a film is formed that
      would tend to spoil your fair impression, you must take great care
      to prevent it. As we say in the craft, the dies should
      be <i lang="it">rosso appunto</i>, to the point of redness, neither
      more nor less; and to make them so you do this. You take some clean
      iron scale<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90"
      class="fnanchor">[90]</a> and place it on a board and then
      rub <i lang="it">pila</i> and <i lang="it">torsello</i> alike on
      this until they are thoroughly bright, and the film quite gone from
      them, and in the same manner may you afterwards brighten your
      coins. And—another little hint—you clean out the deeper parts of
      your dies with pieces of pointed cork tipped with iron scale, &amp;
      then everything is done &amp; you can give your dies to the stamper,
      at the mint.</p>

    <p>I must not forget to tell you, as I promised, how it was that the
      ancients never turned their coins out as well as we; &amp; the
      reason of it was because they cut their dies out direct with
      goldsmith’s tools, gravers, chisels, punches, &amp; that was very
      difficult for them to do, especially as the mints needed a large
      number of these dies—<i lang="it">pile</i>
      and <i lang="it">torselli</i>.</p>

    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span></p>

    <p>I need give you but one instance of what I mean, gentle reader, and
      you will see how right I am. On one occasion when I was making the
      dies for Pope Clement in Rome, I had to turn out thirty of these
      iron <i lang="it">pile</i> and
      <i lang="it">torselli</i> in one day; had I gone to work in the
      manner of the ancients, I could not have produced two, nor would
      they have been as good. Thus it was that the ancients had to employ
      a large number of die cutters, and these could never do their work
      as well as they wished to do it, having never attained our
      facility.</p>

    <p>But now will I tell you of medals which the ancients made
      superlatively well; &amp; whatever I may have omitted in dealing
      with coins I will make up for in treating of medals, so that you
      shall learn all in listening to both.</p>

        MEDALS.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">In dealing with these beautiful things I will
      first explain to you the method adopted by the ancients and then
      tell you how we are wont to go to work nowadays. As far as we can
      gather from the methods of this art, it appears that in the days
      when the art of making medals commenced to flourish in Egypt,
      Greece, and Rome, the rulers put the impressions of their heads on
      one side and on the other some record of the great deeds they had
      done. What strikes us professionals, however, who look deeper into
      the matter, is the variety of medals struck for each emperor by a
      number of different masters. And the reason of this is that when a
      new ruler was elected all the masters of the craft of medal stamping
      in his dominions, and especially those in his immediate residence,
      struck a medal for the occasion, the prince’s head on one side, and
      on the other some commemoration of one of his deeds of honour. Then
      all the many medals were shown to the prince, and his ministers, and
      to him whose work was pronounced the best was awarded the Mastership
      of the Mint, or rather the making of the dies for the coins.</p>

    <p>Now as to their making. The first thing to be done is to make a
      model in white wax of the head, the reverse, and whatever there may
      be, to the exact size and relief of the final work, for we know this
      was how the ancients did it.</p>

    <p>The white model in wax is made as follows: Take a little pure white
      wax, add to it half the quantity of well-ground white lead, &amp; a
      little very clean turps. It depends on the time of the year as to
      whether you put much or little turps, winter requiring half as much
      again as summer. With wooden sticks<a id="FNanchor_91"
      href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> it is worked on a
      surface of stone, bone, or black glass, &amp; thereupon—for the
      ancients and the moderns are at one here—it is made in the gesso
      just as the cardinals’ seals were, of which I erewhile told you.
      Then you take what are called the <i lang="it">taselli</i>, or iron
      implements used for stamping medals, just as in the case of
      the <i lang="it">pile</i> and <i lang="it">torselli</i> you used for
      stamping coins; only in this case they are made alike and not
      dissimilar like the latter. There is a further difference too, and
      this you must be careful about; whereas the latter were made of
      steel and iron, the former are of well-chosen steel and
      four-cornered in shape and the one just like the other. After you
      have softened them in the fire in the same way as I showed you above
      with coins, you smooth and polish<a id="FNanchor_92"
      href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> them very carefully
      with soft stones and mark out the size of your medal, the beading,
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span> the place for the
      inscription &amp; so forth, with just such immovable compasses as
      you used before.</p>

    <p>After this you begin to work with your chisels ever so carefully,
      cutting away the steel in order to round off the form of the head in
      just such manner as you have it in your gesso model. And in this
      manner, little by little, you hollow it out with your tools, but
      using the punches<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93"
      class="fnanchor">[93]</a> as little as possible, because they would
      harden the steel and you would not be able to remove it with your
      cutting tools. This was the way in which the ancients, with their
      wonted diligence and patience, went to work; &amp; in the same way,
      using the chisels and the gravers, did they engrave their letters,
      and thus it comes about that on no ancient medal have I seen really
      good letters, though some are better than others. So much for the
      methods of the ancients.</p>

    <p>Now for another of our practical instances, gentle reader, always
      as I have promised you, something from my own hand. It was a medal
      for Pope Clement VII., and it had two reverses. On the front was the
      head of his Holiness, on the reverse side was the subject of Moses
      with his folk in the desert at the time of the scarcity of
      water. God comes to their help, bidding Aaron, Moses’ brother,
      strike the rock with his staff, from which the living water
      springs. I made it just full of camels and horses, and ever so many
      animals and crowds of people, and the little legend across it
      ‘<i lang="it">Ut bibat populus</i>.’ An alternative reverse bore the
      figure of peace, a lovely maiden with a torch in her hand burning a
      pile of weapons, &amp; at the side the temple of Janus with a Fury
      bound to it, and the legend around of ‘<i lang="it">Claudunter belli
        portae</i>.’ The dies for these medals I prepared<a id="FNanchor_94"
      href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> with
      the <i lang="it">madre</i>, of which I told you above, and the
      punches, using them first in the same way as I did with the
      coins. But I must remind you how I said that the dies for the coins
      were not to be worked on with cutting instruments, gravers and so
      forth; here, with the medals, the contrary holds good, &amp; as soon
      as you have done what you can with your <i lang="it">madre</i> and
      the various little punches that go with it, you must needs finish
      the work ever so carefully with chisels and gravers. The letters are
      stamped in with steel punches, just as was the case with the
      coins. You must take heed, too, while striking, to fix your die on
      to a great block<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95"
      class="fnanchor">[95]</a> of lead. Some, when they strike coins,
      have used hollowed wooden blocks<a id="FNanchor_96"
      href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> for this purpose, but
      this will not answer for medals, as the dies have to be much deeper
      cut, the relief of the medal being so much higher. Just in the same
      way as with the coins you will do well to make wax impressions from
      time to time, while you are cutting, to see
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span> how you are getting
      on. Likewise, before you temper<a id="FNanchor_97"
      href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> the die, make a few
      impressions on lead so as to see how the whole works together, and
      to correct any mistakes. When you are satisfied with the results,
      set to with the tempering of the dies, like you did for the
      coining. Don’t, however, omit to have a pitcher containing about ten
      gallons<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98"
      class="fnanchor">[98]</a> of water. When your die is aglow, grip it
      carefully with the tongs &amp; quickly dip it into the water, and
      not holding it in one position but stirring it round, always keeping
      it under water till it hisses no longer and becomes cold. Then take
      it out &amp; polish it up with powdered iron scale just as you did
      before with the coins.</p>

             <a href="#Page_70">70</a>). I am indebted to Prof. Roberts-Austen for the following
            note: ‘This passage is amplified in the next chapter where the
            author treats of the hardening of medal dies. He has shown
            that before working on the coin dies he has made them as soft
            as possible, but before they could actually be used for
            striking coins they would need “hardening” &amp; “tempering.”
            Hardening steel is effected by heating it to bright redness
            &amp; then quenching it in some fluid which will cool the
            metal with more or less rapidity, cold water being usually
            employed for this purpose. Hence in this chapter Cellini
            states that there must be ten gallons of cold water in which
            the hot die is quenched, &amp; kept moving (as in modern
            practice) until it is cold. “Tempering,” on the other hand, to
            which he alludes here, consists in reducing the hardness of
            the quenched steel by heating it to a moderate temperature
            much below redness. Usually the die would be (in modern
            practice) heated until a straw-coloured film forms on its
            surface. Probably such a film is contemplated by the author
            when he indicates the necessity for removing a film, produced
            at the hardening stage, by polishing with fine oxide of
            iron.’</i></p>

      <h3 id="CHAPTER_XVI_HOW_THE_BEFORE-MENTIONED">CHAPTER XVI. HOW THE
        BEFORE-MENTIONED MEDALS ARE STRUCK.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">Medals are struck in various ways. I will speak
      first of the method
      called <i lang="it">coniare</i><a id="FNanchor_99"
      href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> a term derived from
      this particular method of medal stamping, and then I’ll go on to the
      others of which I have also availed myself.</p>

    <p>You make an iron frame<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100"
      class="fnanchor">[100]</a> about four fingers wide, two fingers
      thick and half a cubit long, and the open space within it should be
      exactly the size of the dies (<i lang="it">taselli</i>) on which
      your medals are cut in intaglio. These dies you remember are square,
      and they have to fit exactly square and equal into the frame so that
      they may be in no way moved in the striking of the medal. Before
      beginning the actual thing, it is necessary first to strike a medal
      of lead of just the size you wish the gold or silver one to be. You
      do it in the usual way, taking the impression of it in caster’s
      sand—you remember we spoke about it before—the same that all the
      founders use for the trappings of horses, mules, and brass work
      generally. From this pattern medal you make your final
      casting<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101"
      class="fnanchor">[101]</a> which you carefully clean up, removing
      the rough edges<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102"
      class="fnanchor">[102]</a> with a file, and after that polishing off
      all the file marks. This done you place the cast medal between your
      dies (<i lang="it">taselli</i>). The medal, in that it is already
      cast into its shape, is more easily struck, and the dies are for the
      same reason less used up in the process of striking. When you have
      them in the middle of your frame, &amp; the frame itself fixed
      firmly upright, push them down into the frame at one end, leaving a
      cavity of three fingers’ space from the edge of it. Into this cavity
      fix two wedges of iron,<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103"
      class="fnanchor">[103]</a> or <i lang="it">biette</i>, the thin ends
      of which are at least half the size of the thick ends and which in
      length are about twice the breadth of the frame. Then when you want
      to do the striking, set them with their thin ends over your dies,
      the point of the one set towards the other.<a id="FNanchor_104"
      href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> Then take two stout
      hammers, and let your apprentice hold one at the head of one of the
      wedges, and do you strike with the other hammer the opposite wedge
      three or four times, very carefully alternating your blows first on
      one wedge, then on the other. The object of this is as a precaution
      to prevent the shifting &amp; facilitate the action of your
      dies<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105"
      class="fnanchor">[105]</a> or the
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span> pieces of metal that
      are to form your medals. Then take your frame, set the head of one
      of the wedges on a big stone &amp; strike the other head with a
      large hammer called in the craft <i lang="it">mazzetta</i>, using
      both your hands.</p>

    <p>This you repeat three or four times, turning the frame round at
      every second stroke. This done, take out your medal. If the medal be
      of bronze it will have been necessary to soften it
      first,<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106"
      class="fnanchor">[106]</a> for that is too hard a metal to strike
      straight off without heating; and repeat this three or four times
      until you see that the impression is sharp. True it is I could give
      you hundreds of little wrinkles yet, but I don’t intend to do it,
      because I assume I am speaking to those who have some knowledge of
      the art, and for those who haven’t it would be dreadfully boring to
      listen. So much for the method of striking medals that we
      call <i lang="it">coniare</i>.<a id="FNanchor_107"

        XVII. ANOTHER WAY OF STRIKING MEDALS WITH THE SCREW.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">You make an iron frame of similar size &amp;
      thickness to the one described above, but of sufficient length to
      enable it to hold not only the two dies, <i lang="it">taselli</i>,
      on which the medal is cut, but also the female<a id="FNanchor_108"
      href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> screw of
      bronze. This screw is set beneath the male screw of
      iron;<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109"
      class="fnanchor">[109]</a> one ought really to apply the term
      screw, <i lang="it">vite</i>, to this male screw only, the female
      screw being called <i lang="it">chiocciola</i>. The male screw
      should be three fingers thick and its threads<a id="FNanchor_110"
      href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> square, because it
      is stronger thus than of the usual shape. The frame has to have a
      hole in the top of it to admit of the screw passing through it. When
      you have placed your dies,
      <i lang="it">taselli</i>, beneath the screw, with the metal you
      propose to strike between them, you tighten them up by the insertion
      of iron wedges<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111"
      class="fnanchor">[111]</a> so that they cannot possibly shift. You
      will find this necessary owing to the greater size of the bronze
      screw.<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112"
      class="fnanchor">[112]</a> Then having prepared a piece of beam
      about two cubits long, or more, you fix an iron rod of sufficient
      thickness and of about two cubits in length to the lower end of it,
      and it must fit into the beam;<a id="FNanchor_113"
      href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> then fix your frame
      into a cutting in the head of the beam made exactly to hold it. It
      is necessary, too, to bind the beam round with stout iron bands to
      give it strength at the place where the frame is set in, and to
      prevent it from splitting.</p>

    <p>Round the head of the screw must then be fitted a stout iron ring
      with two loops to it, &amp; these have to be made to hold a long
      iron rod or bar,<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114"
      class="fnanchor">[114]</a> say six cubits in length, so that four
      men can work at it, and bring their force to play upon your dies and
      the medal you are striking. In this method I struck about one
      hundred of the medals I made for Pope Clement; they were done in the
      purest bronze without any casting, which, as I told above, is
      necessary for the process called <i lang="it">coniare</i>. I advise
      every artist to
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span> note well this method
      of striking with the screw, for, though it be more expensive, the
      impressions are better, and the dies not so soon worn out.  Of the
      gold and silver medals I struck many straight off without 
      <ins class="corr" id="softening" 
      title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: softenening">softening</ins>?
      them first; &amp; as for the cost, perhaps after all it only appears
      greater, for whereas in the method of striking with the
      screw<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115"
      class="fnanchor">[115]</a> two turns of the screw will complete the
      medal, in the method of striking in the <i lang="it">coniare</i>
      process at least one hundred blows with the stamps are necessary
      before you get the desired result.</p>

        TO BEGIN MAKING A VASE.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">It is quite wonderful what a variety of different
      methods there are for making silver vases. We might here begin with
      the casting of silver, and then little by little get on to other
      subjects. There are three ways of melting silver so that it shall
      not burn.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117"
      class="fnanchor">[117]</a> In the first you use the bellows,
      constructing round their mouth a little brick furnace sufficient to
      quite cover the crucible, even to be some four fingers above it;
      then rub the crucible all over, inside and out, with olive oil; put
      the silver into it &amp; place it on the furnace; you should not
      have too many coals aglow at first for fear of cracking the
      crucible, for that is apt to happen with the sudden heat, but let it
      get gradually hotter and hotter, without touching your bellows,
      until it is red hot. At this point you gently start blowing with the
      bellows. After a while you will see the silver beginning to float
      like water; then you strew a handful of tartar over it, and while it
      stays a moment so, take a piece of linen folded four or five times
      &amp; well soaked in oil, to lay this over the crucible when you
      remove it from the coals. Then swiftly take hold of the crucible
      with your cramping tongs,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118"
      class="fnanchor">[118]</a> a pair of tongs made specially for
      catching hold of earthen crucibles, for if you catch hold of these
      as you would of iron crucibles you would break them, but these
      special tongs support the earthen crucible so that there is no
      danger of its breaking. Meanwhile, the moulds for pouring silver in
      must be at hand; these are made out of two iron plates of the
      requisite size and as occasion shall demand, and
      beneath<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119"
      class="fnanchor">[119]</a> them place a few square rods about the
      size of your little finger, more or less, as the work may need. The
      plates are then bound together with stout iron clamps, struck with a
      hammer till they grip the moulds equally all round. Of these clamps
      you need six or eight according to the size of the mould. Then you
      paint round the junction of the moulds with liquid clay so as to
      prevent the silver from coming through.<a id="FNanchor_120"
      href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> When your moulds are
      well warmed, you pour a little oil into them, and stand them in an
      earthen pot of spent ashes, or even on the ground between four
      bricks, and so pour in your silver.<a id="FNanchor_121"
      href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> That is one of the
      methods of casting.</p>

        AND A BETTER WAY OF CASTING.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">The Florentine gold-beaters used to have another
      way of casting, which was called casting in the
      mortar,<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122"
      class="fnanchor">[122]</a> for so was the furnace called in which
      the casting was done. You take a number of bands of clean
      iron<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123"
      class="fnanchor">[123]</a> about half a finger thick and as broad as
      a thumb, and weave them into a round shape, about one &amp;
      one-third cubits high, sometimes smaller, sometimes larger than this
      in accordance with the quantity of the work you have to cast. It
      must be interlaced into a domed shape to about two-thirds of its
      circumference, and from the iron that remains over you make four
      legs on which the furnace is to stand. Note that where these legs
      commence you must make a grating, the openings of which are wide
      enough to allow of one finger and a half being put through them,
      this serves as a base for the furnace. And the furnace itself you
      construct by means of fashioning a cake of earth mixed with cloth
      shearings,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124"
      class="fnanchor">[124]</a> the kind of earth that glass-blowers use
      for their furnaces. Then you take a terra cotta tile and lay it on
      the base of your furnace, and strew a little ash over it. On this
      you stand your crucible filled with as much silver as it can hold,
      and set to work very carefully, much as you did in the previous
      method. You fill the furnace with coal, light it and leave it to get
      red by itself, for thus left, the draught will produce a tremendous
      fire, and you will cast better so than if you made fire with your
      bellows. I must warn you too, to make your crucibles out of clean
      iron, for earthenware ones would easily crack; this iron should
      however be coated over inside &amp; out with a paste of clean ashes
      about half a finger in thickness, which must dry well before the
      silver is put in. Some take for this solution clay mixed with cloth
      parings, &amp; the one is as good as the other. For the rest you
      proceed with your casting just as I showed you above.</p>

        ANOTHER FURNACE. SUCH A ONE AS I MADE IN THE CASTLE OF ST.  ANGELO
        AT THE TIME OF THE SACK OF ROME.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">These kinds of furnaces are the best of all. It
      was dire necessity that taught me how to make them, because I had
      absolutely no means at hand for doing my work. Being in a confined
      place, where I had to set about using my wits, I made a virtue of
      necessity. I broke the bricks out of a room, &amp; with these bricks
      I set to work to construct a furnace in the form of a
      bake-oven.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125"
      class="fnanchor">[125]</a> The bricks were arranged alternately, so
      that between every brick was an opening of about two fingers wide,
      &amp; as I went on I narrowed them in upwards.<a id="FNanchor_126"
      href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> When I had raised it
      about a cubit’s height from the ground, I
      constructed<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127"
      class="fnanchor">[127]</a> a grating of shovel handles and spears
      which I broke. And from this point I continued building the furnace
      up and round to about one-and-a-quarter cubit’s height, narrowing it
      in towards the top. Then I found an iron ladle which they were by
      chance using in the kitchen, &amp; as it was pretty big I caked it
      round with a paste of ash &amp; pounded clay,<a id="FNanchor_128"
      href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> and filled it with
      as much gold as it would contain, and gave it the full fire straight
      off as there was no danger of the crucible cracking. When the first
      lot was cast I filled it up again, and so on, till I had melted up
      about 100 lbs. of gold. The whole thing went very easily, and ’tis
      about the best and simplest method you can employ. Perhaps you think
      that I ought to go and give you a diagram of it all here in my book,
      but I fancy that anyone who knows anything at all about the craft of
      founding will perfectly well understand by description. So that’s
      enough for furnaces.</p>

    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">When the silver is cast in the manner described
      above, in the first furnace, it is as well to let it cool on the
      iron plates above mentioned because by so doing it contracts
      better.<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129"
      class="fnanchor">[129]</a> When it is cold you clean off the rough
      edges from around it. This done, you make a
      scraper<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130"
      class="fnanchor">[130]</a> about two-and-a-half fingers broad, &amp;
      it should be blunted; to it you attach a stick shaped with two
      handles, and these are distant about half a cubit from the point of
      the scraper. Note that the scraper should be bent about three
      fingers,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131"
      class="fnanchor">[131]</a> and such as is used for sgraffito
      work, <i lang="it">graffiare</i>.<a id="FNanchor_132"
      href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> With this scraper
      the silver plate is to be planed, and in this wise: You make your
      silver plate red hot &amp; place it on one of the iron plates you
      used for casting it on; fastening it on tightly with certain iron
      tools used for nailing or fastening,<a id="FNanchor_133"
      href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> then setting the
      handle of the scraper to your shoulder with your two hands to the
      two handles that you fastened to it, so that it comes to be in the
      form of a cross, you pare off the surface of your silver plate with
      very firm pressure
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span> till it is thoroughly
      clean.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134"
      class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

    <p>I won’t omit to tell you of a method I once learnt. Whilst in Paris
      I used to work on the largest kind of silver work that the craft
      admits of, and the most difficult to boot. I had in my employ many
      workmen, and inasmuch as they very gladly learnt from me, so I was
      not above learning from them; the plates I planed with such
      diligence gave them cause for much marvelling; but, none the less,
      one charming youth, on whom I set great store, said to me, with the
      utmost modesty, that in Paris it was not customary to plane the
      plate in the way we did it, and albeit our method seemed very
      clever, he would undertake to produce the same result without all
      this planing, and so gain much time.</p>

    <p>To this I replied that I should only be too delighted to save any
      time; so I gave him a pair of vases to do, weighing 20 lbs. a piece,
      and my models for them. Before my very eyes the youth melted his
      silver in the way I told above, &amp; cast it between his iron
      plates. Then he cleaned some of the edges off and <ins class="corr" 
      id="settoright" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: set too right">set to right</ins> away
      to hammer it into shape &amp; give it its rotundity (of which more
      anon) without paring it in any way. Both vases he turned out in this
      way with great care and admirable technique.<a id="FNanchor_135"
      href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> It is just because
      in Paris more work of this kind is done than in any other city of
      the world that the craftsmen, from constant practice, acquire such
      marvellous technical skill. I should never have believed it had I
      not seen it for myself. Then, at first, I thought that it was the
      quality of silver that gave them a vantage, because they work here
      with a finer quality of silver than anywhere else; but my workman
      said no, &amp; that silver of baser alloy would serve his purpose
      equally well. I tried him and found that it was so. From which I
      conclude, therefore, that a man can start straight away with shaping
      what he wants out of his silver without wasting needless time in
      planing it up first. Of course care has to be taken to remove
      certain little blemishes<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136"
      class="fnanchor">[136]</a> from time to time. I do not go so far as
      to say that it is bad to plane the metal first: nay, I have found
      either way good.</p>

    <p>Now let us consider how to make a vase in the shape of an egg. I
      follow, as always, my promised method of giving you of my own
      creations for different princes &amp; great persons. In Rome I made,
      among many other vases, two big ones in the form of an egg each
      about a cubit high, with lips and handles spreading out from the
      top.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137"
      class="fnanchor">[137]</a> One was for the Bishop of Salamanca, a
      Spaniard, and the other for Cardinal Cibo; both were elaborately
      ornamented with foliage and animals of various kinds. These vases
      were called ewers,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138"
      class="fnanchor">[138]
        <span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span></a> and were used
      by the Cardinals on their credence tables on occasions of state.</p>

    <p>Inasmuch as I made numbers of these for King Francis, in Paris, and
      as they were all larger and more richly wrought, I shall draw my
      illustrations from them. You take your plate &amp; trim off the
      rough edges, plane it on both sides, &amp; slightly round the edges
      off,<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139"
      class="fnanchor">[139]</a> and forasmuch as the plates are cast in
      somewhat oblong shapes, you beat them into a rounded shape with your
      hammer, and this is how you do it: you take your red hot plate, not
      too red, for then it would crack,<a id="FNanchor_140"
      href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> but sufficient, I
      would say, to burn certain little grains of powder or dust thrown on
      to it; &amp; put it on the stake, and you beat it very firmly with
      the thin end of the hammer from one angle to the other driving the
      metal well to the centre,<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141"
      class="fnanchor">[141]</a> so that when all the four corners of your
      plate are done it will be marked somewhat the shape of a
      cross.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142"
      class="fnanchor">[142]</a> After this you reverse the process and
      work with the hammer outwards, annealing the plate some four times,
      till it is of such roundness as your good craftsman may see fit. And
      when it is rounded into the shape of the vase you have in mind you
      must see that the measurement of the diameter of your plate exceeds
      that of the future vase by about three fingers, and that the plate
      must be kept as thick as possible in the middle. Before you hit this
      size exactly you take an iron stake about a finger thick and six
      fingers long, as blunt as possible so as not to pierce the plate,
      this tool you put with its broad end on the anvil, and you very
      carefully balance<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143"
      class="fnanchor">[143]</a> your silver plate on the point of the
      stake until it stands steady by its own weight.  When the point is
      fixed, get one of your handy lads to strike it with the broad end of
      the hammer so that it makes a mark in the plate. I have no doubt
      there are masters who can find the centre point straight away
      without having recourse to this little dodge, especially when
      working on small plates, but for large pieces I have always found it
      very helpful. After this you turn the plate round again on the anvil
      &amp; strike it in the same manner on the stake till the point,
      which so far was only indicated, is now boldly marked. Then you take
      your compasses &amp; strike a circle which will show you how far
      your outline is out, and so on, hammering the silver in conformity
      with it by repeated heating and beating. All the while you have to
      be very careful not to lose your centre point, and to beat the
      silver out, as I said before, so that the diameter of the plate
      exceeds that of the future vase by some three fingers. Applying your
      compasses again, you strike a series of concentric circles about a
      half a finger apart from each other, &amp; starting from the centre
      of the cup. Then you take a kind of hammer about one finger thick at
      the narrow end, and one-and-a-half at the broad end; this hammer is
      battered and rounded off<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144"
      class="fnanchor">[144]</a> into somewhat the shape of
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span> the fleshy part of a
      finger, and with it you begin beating in the middle of the plate, at
      the centre point in fact, being careful always not to lose the
      point. The movement of the hammer should be in the form of a
      spiral,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145"
      class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and follow the concentric circles; you
      take turn about in beating and heating in this manner till you see
      the silver grow into the shape of a hat, or at least its
      crown,<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146"
      class="fnanchor">[146]</a> &amp; thus approximating to the form of
      your vase. The thing to observe is that the metal should spread
      equally all round, for if it gives more on one side than the other
      it would be uneven; and in this way you draw it inwards till it is
      as deep as the body of your model requires. Then with various
      different stakes, each adapted specially to the form you are at work
      on, you beat, now with the broad, now with the narrow end of the
      hammer, and right into the body of your vase till it is equally
      bellied all round; and when this has all been very carefully done,
      always working on the stakes—some of which are called ‘cows’
      tongues’<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147"
      class="fnanchor">[147]</a> because of their shape—you work up the
      neck of the vase to the necessary height, and similarly on other
      stakes specially curved for the purpose, you little by little narrow
      out the neck. Any little imperfections<a id="FNanchor_148"
      href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a> on the surface you
      remove as you go on, and so finally see the neck of the vase take
      the perfect shape you wish it to have.</p>

    <p>When you have thus finished the neck, you can begin to work the
      bas-relief on the body of the vase; like a vase, for instance, that
      I made for King Francis,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149"
      class="fnanchor">[149]</a> it was one among many, but it was the
      finest of the lot.  I filled it with black pitch made in the manner
      I described to you before, then I divided out the body of the vase
      for the figures, animals &amp; leaves, which I drew on it with a
      stylus of burnished steel. This done, I drew them over again with
      pen &amp; ink, using all the delicacy that good drawing
      requires. Then I took my punches, these are of iron, about the
      length of a finger and about the thickness of a goose’s quill. They
      are all shaped in different ways, some are fashioned like a C,
      beginning with a small c, and ending with a large
      one,<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150"
      class="fnanchor">[150]</a> some are bent more, some less, and some
      are almost quite straight.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151"
      class="fnanchor">[151]</a> Others, again, are greater, diminishing
      from the size of a man’s thumb to six different smaller sizes, and
      all these selections you ought to have. With them, and with a hammer
      weighing some three or four ounces, and striking most dexterously,
      you beat into relief whatever you have designed. Then you place your
      vase on a slow fire and melt out the pitch. After this you heat the
      vase once more and clean it with a solution of tartar and salt, in
      equal proportions as I described above. When the vase is quite clean
      you employ a set of iron tools like stakes and with long
      horns,<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152"
      class="fnanchor">[152]</a> technically
      termed <i lang="it">caccianfuori</i>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>, ‘snarling irons’:
      they are made of pure iron, long or short as the case may be, and as
      the work may need. These <i lang="it">caccianfuori</i> have to be
      fastened into the anvil stock,<a id="FNanchor_153"
      href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> then you put one of
      the horns into the vase, so that the point of the horn, which should
      be in shape and rounded like your little finger, is applied to the
      inside of the vase, &amp; to the parts you want to beat out; and you
      very gently strike the other end of it with the hammer so that the
      blow passing to the end of the horn adjoining the body of the vase,
      bosses up the silver from within at such points as your learned and
      cunning master may deem well. When this process has been applied to
      all the figures, animals, and foliage, you heat and cleanse the vase
      once more, once more fill it with pitch, and with other sorts of
      punches, similar in all respects to the first, but having their ends
      shaped like beans, and large or small as the case may be, you begin
      the bossing again. Each master uses his own particular punches,
      &amp; all have their own little ways of working, but all have this
      in common that the punches do not cut but only press the metal. The
      process of melting out &amp; re-applying the pitch may now be
      repeated two or three times as may be thought necessary, till you
      have got your figures and foliage to the highest point of
      workmanship, then melt it out for the last time. After this you may
      proceed to fashion in wax whatever graces may have place at lip or
      handle, improving on the model or design with which you
      started. These finished, you can make them in all sorts of different
      ways, ways so many, that they were wearisome to recount. The easiest
      of these was the one I usually employed, and particularly in the
      vase I made for King Francis.<a id="FNanchor_154"
      href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> I took earth, such
      as the makers of artillery use, dried it and sifted it well, then I
      mixed it with fine cloth shearings and a little cows’ dung sifted
      through a sieve, then I beat it all well together. After this I took
      some tripoli, such as jewellers use to polish their gems with,
      pounded it up very fine &amp; made from it a pigment as for
      painting, streaking it over the wax ornaments.  This I also did to
      the inlet holes and vent channels after I had duly affixed them to
      the models. I always took care to fix these vent holes down below,
      and pass them upwards, but at such distance from the inlet channel
      that none of the silver should spill into them, and thus prevent
      them doing their work. When I had applied the first coat of tripoli
      I let it dry.  Then I took the clay of which I told you before &amp;
      coated the work over to the thickness of a knife’s back, letting it
      dry again, and repeating this process, till the different coats were
      about a finger thick. Then I bound it all round with iron bands as
      many as it could hold, over these iron bands I put more coats of
      clay, this time mixed up with rather more cloth shearings than I had
      used previously, &amp; applied another coat again of a knife’s back
      thickness. Then I applied the whole to a slow fire, holding the
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span> vent holes downwards,
      and so gradually melted out the wax, which I caught in a little
      receptacle down beneath. One has to be very careful not to have the
      fire too hot, for that would make the wax bubble, and so damage the
      mould within. When the wax is quite melted out, you remove the mould
      from where it is attached to the vase, clean it carefully of all
      wax, and close up the place where it is attached to the vase with
      the same earth that is used above. This done, you bind the whole
      thing round again with fine bands of iron wire, &amp; cover it up
      completely with a further coating of the tripoli mixture. Then you
      heat it on charcoal, firing it and the charcoal together in a brick
      furnace; and mind to get it well baked, for this kind of earth
      differs from others, in that it should all be fired at one
      turn. Meantime, have your silver ready for casting, or I would say
      molten, and while this is in progress put your mould into a large
      receptacle filled with sand, which should be moist, not wet; &amp;
      fix it in well as do the casters of artillery into their troughs,
      but with the greater delicacy that the handling of lighter metal
      requires.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155"
      class="fnanchor">[155]</a> When your silver is well molten, throw
      finely powdered tartar over it to keep it fresh.  Then take a piece
      of linen, the size of the crucible, folded into four and soaked with
      olive oil, and spread it over the tartar that covers the silver; and
      grip the crucible with the tongs
      called <i lang="it">imbracciatoie</i>. You ought to have many kinds
      of these, small, medium, great, and adaptable to the quantity of
      silver you have to melt; they hold the crucible together and prevent
      it breaking—that happened to me many a time. Just as you’ve got your
      silver nicely molten and are pouring it into the mould, crack goes
      your crucible, and all your work and time and pains are lost! Take
      note therefore of this, while pouring your silver into the mould,
      let one of your assistants hold the linen rag from slipping from the
      crucible, for by so holding the rag on, it has two good results; it
      keeps the silver warm and it prevents the little bits of coal from
      falling into the mould. This also you may take note of: if you have
      little masks and such-like conceits to apply to your vase, when you
      have fashioned them all carefully in wax and taken them off the vase
      having made moulds of them as above described, you lay in the hollow
      of the moulds a coating of wax, a thin knife’s back more or less in
      thickness, or of such thickness as you wish your mask to be. This
      coating you spread equally all over. In the craft it is called
      the <i lang="it">lasagna</i>. When you have fixed on to it the inlet
      channel &amp; the vent holes—just as I told you above, the latter
      fixed at the bottom &amp; turning to the top—you fill in the whole
      with the clay, bind around with wire, and cast in the same way as
      before.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156"
      class="fnanchor">[156]</a> This method you can employ in the handles
      &amp; the feet of your vase, where you find the hammer difficult to
      work with, and I counsel you in working large vases always to employ
      this method of casting.</p>

    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">Let us take another method of casting similar to
      the last; I have tried it often and found it splendid; ’tis this:
      You take some fresh, finely powdered and ground gesso, and you grind
      in like manner, &amp; mix with it, a little brick dust, two-thirds
      of the latter to one-third of the former. Mix them well together
      with clean cold water into a paste; then take a hog sable, &amp;
      working with its softest part, paint over your wax model as you did
      before with the clay. This time you put it all on at one go, because
      as you gradually paint along with your brush, the gesso as gradually
      sets,<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157"
      class="fnanchor">[157]</a> so that you can soon lay it on to a
      finger’s thickness with a wooden spoon. Then you bind the mould with
      fine well-tempered iron wire, weaving it all round, in and across,
      and, taking the thick rest of your gesso that has not been passed
      through the sieve, you moisten it with a little water &amp; cake it
      on to the mould as before, to the thickness of a knife’s back, till
      all the iron wire is well covered over. Of course, the larger your
      mould is the larger must this shell of gesso also be
      proportionately. You will do well, too, unless pressed for time in
      finishing your work, to let the gesso dry a bit in the sun or in a
      warm and smoky corner, so that all the moisture leaves it.  Then you
      put it over a slow fire and melt out the wax as you did in the
      former process; let the fire grow greater when the wax has all
      melted out, &amp; bake the mould just as you did before with the
      earthen mould. This is a good and an expeditious way to work in, and
      very useful if you want to finish anything quickly.</p>

    <p class="drop-capx">In the third method the wax models are cut into
      small pieces, powdered and moulded in clay, and set in the troughs
      as described above.  When the moulds are made, with due observance
      to the undercutting (I say this advisedly), lead castings are made
      from them, and these as well cleaned and worked up as the master may
      be minded; then they are cast in silver in the same troughs as I
      told you before. This is a particularly good way, because when the
      master has his lead model and has finished it up to suit his
      purpose, it can serve ever so many more times than a single
      casting.</p>

        FIGURES MADE IN SILVER &amp; GREATER THAN LIFE SIZE.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">Now as to the way of making a great statue of
      silver; and when I say a great statue I mean as big as a live man or
      bigger. Statues of one-and-a-half cubits high I have of course seen
      plenty of in Rome on the altar of St. Peter’s, and albeit the making
      of these is pretty difficult and many excellent masters employ on
      them much admirable work, still these smaller statues present no
      great difficulties in the way of soldering, because they can be
      handled in the furnace entire; moreover they are made of thinner
      plates<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158"
      class="fnanchor">[158]</a> of silver than the large ones. The actual
      process of both is much the same, but the large ones are so much
      harder to manage that I for my part have never seen any that were
      presentable.  According to my promise of giving you some practical
      example either of work I have seen of others or of my own making,
      I’ll tell you the following.</p>

    <p>The Emperor Charles V. was passing through France in the time of
      Francis I., for the great war had ended, and Francis, my glorious
      king, among the other wonderful presents he had given to the
      Emperor, gave him a silver statue of a Hercules with two columns,
      which was about three and a half cubits high. You remember how I
      described above the beauty of all the things made in that great city
      of Paris—well, I have never seen anywhere else in the world such
      perfect hammer work as in that city, but with all their technique
      (in the methods of embossing) not even the best masters were able to
      give to that statue either grace, beauty or
      style;<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159"
      class="fnanchor">[159]</a> and for the simple reason that they did
      not know how to solder properly, and so had to stick on the legs and
      the head and the arms by means of fastening<a id="FNanchor_160"
      href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> them with silver
      wire. Now King Francis wanted to have eleven statues like this made,
      and he complained to me that those men of his had not been able to
      undertake such a job, and he asked me if it lay in the art to do it
      &amp; if I saw my way through. I replied that most assuredly did I
      see my way through, that I could do these things much better than
      talk about them, and that when done they would be one hundred times
      finer than was anticipated. And this was the way in which I began
      explaining it to that great king, and quoth I:</p>
    <p>
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span></p>
    <p>‘There are many different ways of doing the thing &amp; each master
      chooses the method to which his technical excellence or his fancy
      guides him.  First of all you make a statue in clay of the size you
      want your silver statue to be, then you make a gesso mould of it in
      many pieces, and this is the way: The whole breast to the middle of
      the ribs at the sides, &amp; to the juncture of the throat above
      &amp; the legs at the groining below, forms one piece. The next
      piece comprises the back from the juncture of the neck and contains
      the shoulders and down to the buttocks. These are the two main
      pieces. In like manner must the arms, legs, and head all be formed
      into two pieces. And because the undercuttings would impede the
      removal of the pieces, these are filled up with wax. The gesso
      moulds are then respectively cast in bronze. And you have your sheet
      of silver handy of such size as may be deemed expedient by the
      skilful master, &amp; commence to hammer it over the bronze with
      wooden hammers, carefully rounding the silver over the various
      forms; by means of frequent annealing these forms come to be
      beautifully covered. The discreet and cunning master in order to
      just connect separate pieces together<a id="FNanchor_161"
      href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> applies a few
      additional hammer strokes to their edges, and expands them to about
      two knife backs one over the other. These edges he cuts into jags
      about two fingers apart with a pair of scissors, fits the one into
      the other, and with nice judgment tightens them with a hammer,
      holding them over a round stake, or some other piece of iron as
      shall hinder the hammer from indenting the silver where it has
      nothing to back it. In this way all the pieces are done, first the
      body, then the legs, arms and head.  After this they are filled with
      pitch, and wrought over with hammer &amp; punches to an exact
      likeness with the original clay model, &amp; finally soldered
      together into one.’</p>

    <p>When I had delivered myself of these words to the King, he said it
      was all so clear &amp; he had understood it all so well that he very
      nearly thought he would himself be able to undertake such work. Then
      I told his Majesty that there were other methods which a master
      thoroughly conversant with his craft might employ, and that these
      methods were really easier in execution though they seemed harder of
      explanation. Whereupon his Majesty retorted that verily he was a
      great lover of genius,<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162"
      class="fnanchor">[162]</a> that I had spoken so convincingly of the
      first that he would willingly take my word for the other.</p>

    <p>One of them was as follows: when I had cast the King’s silver into
      sheets
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span> in the way I told
      above, and had my clay model of the subsequent size of the silver
      ready completed, I went straight at the job, with sheer ability of
      hammer work<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163"
      class="fnanchor">[163]</a> together with my general skill of
      craftsmanship, striking from front and from back in whatever way the
      art demanded. By this method I got through much quicker than the
      first. Arms, legs and body I hammered out in separate pieces, and
      the head in one whole piece just as it were a vase, &amp; in the
      manner I told of once before. When I had given them all their shape
      I soldered &amp; fitted them together as before. The solder I used
      was <i lang="it">ottavo</i>, that is a solder composed of one-eighth
      part of an ounce of copper to one of silver. To do the soldering I
      had fixed to the tube of my big bellows several channels of such
      length as I deemed necessary for the purpose of blowing from below
      on the beds of coal that I had placed under the back of my
      work. When this and the coal was aglow, that is, of a golden colour,
      I blew the bellows on it gradually and made the solder run, and I
      kept on with this, now applying it from above, now from below,
      <ins class="corr" id="wherever" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: where-ever">wherever</ins>
      I thought it necessary, and going from point to
      point.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164"
      class="fnanchor">[164]</a> I have said nothing about borax, for it
      stands to reason, as anyone who knows anything about his business is
      aware, that no soldering can be done without it. If it turn out
      that, owing to the length of the pieces, some of them are not
      completely soldered and that fresh solder and borax is needed, I
      used instead of water to take a bit of tallow candle in order not to
      have to cool the whole of my large piece, &amp; on this ointment I
      put my new solder and borax, and this had the same effect as the
      water. Thus did I solder all the different members, head, arms,
      feet, each for itself, filled them with pitch, &amp; with my punches
      gave the last finish but one<a id="FNanchor_165"
      href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> to my work. Then
      came the job of soldering the big pieces together, &amp; that was
      where those great French experts failed.</p>

    <p>I built in the middle of one of my large rooms—and I mean exactly
      in the middle—a little wall about one cubit from the ground, four
      cubits long, and one-and-a-half wide; and after fitting the parts to
      the body I bound them on with silver wire instead of iron wire which
      is usually employed, and in this way, doing three fingers’ width at
      a time, and not without the greatest difficulty, I bound the two
      legs to the body. Then I laid it on the wall over a good fire, and
      applied <i lang="it">quinto</i> to it, <i>i.e.</i>, solder composed
      of one-fifth of an ounce of copper to one of silver—I say copper not
      bronze,<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166"
      class="fnanchor">[166]</a> because copper is easier to treat with
      the punches and holds better, albeit
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span> it does not run quite
      so easily. As I worked with eleven-and-a-half silver to half
      copper<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167"
      class="fnanchor">[167]</a> I had nothing to fear as far as the
      latter was concerned; &amp; I would have everyone aware that if he
      wish to make his job succeed he must not employ inferior silver.</p>

    <p>When my work lay in position I began, with four of my young men, to
      blow the fire with the aid of fans and hand-bellows until I saw the
      solder run, when I every now and then sprinkled a little soft ash
      over it, for if one were to use water instead of ash, one would not
      be able to add fresh solder where the old has run imperfectly. In
      this manner, following just the method I have described, I happily
      succeeded in soldering the whole piece with breast, legs, arms,
      &amp; head; &amp; ere ever a piece cooled I managed to solder it on;
      the whole thing succeeded most admirably, &amp; was just lovely! So
      the entire statue, which was about four cubits high, was lifted off
      the fire all soldered; I cleaned it up with the tools for cleaning,
      which I described before, filled it with pitch, and gave it the
      final polish with the punches.  Then I fixed it on a base of bronze,
      the latter about two-thirds of a cubit high, with sundry little
      subjects in bas-relief gilded and beautifully executed.  The statue
      in question was a figure of Jupiter<a id="FNanchor_168"
      href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> holding the
      lightning bolt in his right hand, and from the lightning a torch was
      kindled; in his left he held a ball to symbolise the world. Round
      the head and the feet was abundance of ornamental detail; &amp; all
      this was admirably gilded, the which was most difficult to do.</p>

    <p>Nor will I omit to tell how I cleaned<a id="FNanchor_169"
      href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> up the silver of so
      large a piece of work, albeit I have already described to you the
      process of cleaning silver, for there were exceptional difficulties
      in this case. I did it thuswise: I went to the shop of a dyer of
      woollen cloth and got one of his big vessels,<a id="FNanchor_170"
      href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> large enough to put
      my figure in, which, as I said, was about four cubits high, and
      weighed about 300 lbs.; then I took four iron rods, each about four
      cubits long, and four chestnut staves, somewhat longer than the iron
      rods.  When the figure was carefully cleaned of its solder, and made
      smooth and polished and carefully pumiced over, we lifted it with
      the four iron rods on to a big bed of coal spread out on the ground,
      and large enough to hold the figure. This we did not do, however,
      till the coals were burnt out, had lost their vigour, and were well
      spent; then we covered the figure all over, shovelling the embers
      upon it, a very tiring job this, as you may imagine, because of the
      heat and fume of the embers. We went on shovelling them
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span> about over the statue
      wherever the need was, till the whole piece was of an equal red heat
      all over. Then we raised it with the four iron rods, let it cool,
      and when it was cold had ready our vessel<a id="FNanchor_171"
      href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> with the blanching
      solution,<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172"
      class="fnanchor">[172]</a> that is to say, water with tartar and
      salt composed as I described to you above, and into it we placed the
      figure by means of the four wooden staves, for the solution must not
      be touched by iron. When inside we stirred it about and scrubbed it
      all over with certain big hog sable brushes much like those used for
      whitening walls &amp; objects of similar size. When we saw it
      getting white, we took it with great care out of this vessel and put
      it into another similar one, but filled with pure water, &amp; here
      we carefully washed all the blanching solution off it. Then we
      poured off the water and dried it very carefully; after which we set
      to gilding whatever parts had to be gilded. Though the gilding of
      this statue was a much harder job than you can possibly imagine, I
      do not intend here to enter into those difficulties of detail, but
      will confine myself to saying a word or two about gilding in
      general. Forsooth, it is a beautiful and marvellous craft this,
      &amp; it well becomes your big masters to know of it, so that they
      may guide such as practise professionally. I knew many, both in
      France and in Rome, who applied themselves only to gilding. But none
      the less I say that great masters ought not to practise this
      themselves, for the quicksilver that has to be used for it is a
      deadly<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173"
      class="fnanchor">[173]</a> poison, and so wears out the men that
      practise in it that they live but a few years.</p>

        TO GILD.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">When you want to gild you take the purest,
      cleanest, 24 carat gold, &amp; you beat it out with clean hammers on
      an anvil, until you get it to the thinness of a sheet of writing
      paper. Then you cut up as much as you want into small pieces. After
      this you take a new crucible never yet used &amp; such as goldsmiths
      melt silver and gold in, and into it you put so much quicksilver,
      free from all impurities, as may be needed for the gold you want to
      employ. The proportion is at the rate of one ounce to a scudi’s
      weight, that is to say, one part of gold to eight parts of
      quicksilver, rather less than more of the latter. Note that you
      should first mix together the quicksilver and the gold in a clean
      vessel of earth or wood, and you put the crucible on a fire of
      glowing embers, but not using the bellows. When the crucible is red
      you throw into it some of the mixed quicksilver and gold, hold it
      over the fire, and with a glowing ember gripped in a pair of tongs
      stir it thoroughly together. Your eye &amp; the feel of your hand
      will tell you whether the gold be dissolved and united with the
      quicksilver. Great care has to be taken to aid the solution by rapid
      stirring, for if you hold it too long, the gold, or rather the
      amalgam will get too thick; if, on the other hand, you hold it on
      too short a time, it will be too thin, and the gold not well
      mixed. The great care which this requires can only be got by
      practice. When it is all mixed &amp; dissolved, &amp; everything
      done in the manner described, you take the hot mixture &amp; pour it
      into a little beaker or vase in accord with the amount of the gold
      you have mixed, and this vase is filled with water, so that you hear
      it hissing when you pour the mixture in. Then you wash it thus two
      or three times in other clean water, till finally your water is
      quite clean and pure, and then you set about the actual gilding as
      follows.</p>

    <p>Wherever you want to gild on your work you have to get it well
      polished &amp; scratch-brushed,<a id="FNanchor_174"
      href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a> for so it is called
      in the craft. These scratch-brushes are made of brass wire about as
      thick as thread<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175"
      class="fnanchor">[175]</a> &amp; done up into bundles about as thick
      as a man’s finger, more or less, in accordance with the size of the
      work you want to scrub, &amp; tied round with brass or copper
      wire. Of course you can buy these brushes at a grocer’s, but there
      they are usually sold only of one size; so that your skilled workman
      if he wants to do his work well, and has a large piece to do, binds
      up his own brushes himself according to the size he wants.</p>

    <p>After the scrubbing, you put the amalgam on with
      an <i lang="it">avvivatoio</i>,<a id="FNanchor_176"
      href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">[176]
        <span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span></a> for so we call
      the little rod of copper set in a wooden handle, &amp; much the same
      size and length as a table fork; here, again, the size accords with
      the requirements of your work. Carefully then do you proceed to
      spread the amalgam over the places you want to gild. True it is that
      some have put quicksilver on first, and then spread the amalgam
      after, but this is not a good method, for too much mercury dulls the
      colour and the beauty of the gold. Others, again, have thought to do
      better by putting the gold on in successive times. This I have
      likewise seen done, but have come to the conclusion that the best
      way is to put all the gold on at once that you want for your
      gilding, and then heat it over a slow fire, till all the quicksilver
      goes off in fumes. If you notice that the gold on your work is not
      even, you can, while it is still warm, very easily add on as much as
      may make it so, till all is covered with gold. Then let it cool by
      itself. I forgot to say in its proper place that if the gold won’t
      stick on you will do well to have a little of the whitening
      water<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>
      of which I told you above, and you dip your <ins class="corr" id="avvivatoio"
      title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: avvivitoio"><i lang="it">avvivatoio</i></ins> with the gold in this water, &amp;
      if that still won’t help you, take a little aquafortis evaporated
      and weakened, and there’s no doubt that will do it.</p>

        RECIPE FOR MAKING COLOURS &amp; COLOURING THE GILDED PARTS.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">The first is colour for thin gilding. You take
      equal proportions of sulphur, tartar well-pounded, and salt,
      grinding them separately, then you take half a part of
      cuccuma<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178"
      class="fnanchor">[178]</a> and you mix them all four together. When
      you have the gilded parts well cleaned &amp; scratch-brushed, as I
      described above, you take a little urine of children or boys, put it
      tepid into a clean pipkin and apply it with hog sables, and the
      virtue of the urine and the sables will remove any dirt or grease
      that may have come on the gold. This done, you get a copper
      cauldron, or mayhap an earthen pot, &amp; in one of the twain, after
      filling it with boiling water, you put your colour composition &amp;
      stir it well up with a rod or a bunch of twigs till it is thoroughly
      dissolved and mixed. Then you tie a bit of string, long enough to
      hold it by, on to the work, and dangle it in for such time as one
      might say an Ave Maria; after this you pull it out and dip it into a
      vase of clear cold water. If it has not taken colour enough you put
      it back again into the hot water, and so on for two or three times
      till it be sufficient, minding, however, not to let it stay in over
      long or else it will turn black and spoil the gilding. This
      colouring matter is the weakest one can make and can only be used
      for one turn.</p>

      saltpetre, vitriol,<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180"
      class="fnanchor">[180]</a> and salts of ammonia, but half as much of
      the first as of the other ingredients; take each by weight, and
      pound each separately; and be careful to pound them very fine; when
      pounded stir them up in clear water to the consistency of a paste,
      and while you are stirring see that you go on grinding them up till
      all the particles are well blended. This done, you must put them in
      a rather big vase because the composition bubbles up; and mind that
      the vase has a glazed surface, or better still be of glass, and let
      it be corked. In order to put the colour on, your work must needs be
      thickly gilded, or else it will turn black, for this colour is very
      powerful.  But if it be sufficiently strongly gilded the work will
      colour beautifully.  The colouring stuff is applied with a paint
      brush, but you must mind not to touch the silver or you will black
      it. Painted over in this wise you set your work to the fire, give it
      a good steaming and dip it into fresh water, but you must mind not
      to overdo the steaming or the gold would be eaten away and not
      hold.</p>

      href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> and gild it, then
      skilfully dry it; don’t be particular as to drying it too much, only
      let it be free of all quicksilver, then clean it again lightly and
      heat it over live embers. Whilst it is in process of heating spread
      on it a kind of wax which I will describe below.</p>

    <p>When the wax is spread, let the work cool, then have a fire ready
      of such nature as shall melt off the wax without heating the metal
      to redness.  When heated in this way, rinse it out in a solution of
      tartar and water—what among goldsmiths is
      called <i lang="it">grommata</i>. This done, let it stand for such

      href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> If your work has

      and beginning to steam hard (do not let it steam quite dry) dip it
      in cold water. Then clean it up, &amp; once again let it simmer

        CERTAIN PLACES.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">When you have cleaned up the parts where the gold
      is not to stick, you take some flour dust, such as you may gather on
      the walls and cornices of mills, &amp; we in Florence
      call <i lang="it">fuscello</i>, and you mix it with water to the
      consistency of a paste, and with a (camel’s) hair brush lay it thick
      on the parts not to be gilded, after which you dry it well before a
      slow fire, and can gild safely.</p>

    <p>Another way, too, may be employed where the flour dust is not used.
      You take gesso in the cake,<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190"
      class="fnanchor">[190]</a> such as the shoemakers use, pound it up
      well, and make a paste of it either with stag
      glue,<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191"
      class="fnanchor">[191]</a> or better with fish
      glue,<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192"
      class="fnanchor">[192]</a> but mind that either glue be well mixed
      with water, so that it does not get too stiff. And inasmuch as I
      want to omit nothing, I bid you note that this gesso is best
      employed when you merely want to gild and leave the silver white,
      whereas the flour dust method is best used when you want in addition
      to colour the gold as above described. This is as much as you need
      know about such matters.</p>

    <p>Now though, of a truth, the prime merit of every craft is your
      being well able to practise it yourself, yet none the less it were
      better to leave these processes of gilding to those who are
      specialists, for it is as I said very unhealthy<a id="FNanchor_193"
      href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">[193]</a> to
      practise. Know <em>how</em> it’s done, that’s all.</p>

        ETCHING.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">First I will talk of that mixture with which you
      etch on copper instead of cutting with the graver, this is an easy
      and a very beautiful method. Aquafortis for etching is made thus:
      you take half an ounce of sublimate,<a id="FNanchor_195"
      href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> one ounce of
      vitriol, half an ounce of rock alum,<a id="FNanchor_196"
      href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> half an ounce of
      verdigris, and six lemons; and after having care to pound the first
      mentioned substances well, you boil them a little in the lemon
      juice, but not so as to let them get too dry. The boiling should be
      done in a glazed pot, and if you have no lemons you may take strong
      vinegar which will give a like result. When you have well smoothed
      your copper plate you can take any ordinary
      varnish,<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197"
      class="fnanchor">[197]</a> such as is used for the lacquering of the
      ornaments on daggers and other iron work, &amp; heat it gently,
      putting a little wax with it, this you do to prevent the varnish
      from cracking when you draw upon it. It must not be too hot when you
      spread it on your copper plate. When you have etched on your design
      make a ridge of wax round the plate and pour on the parting water,
      letting it stand not longer than half an hour. If then it be not
      bitten deep enough, do it again. Then remove it and clean it well
      with a sponge. You draw on the varnish with a stylus of well
      tempered steel, that is an iron needle, which in the craft is termed
      a <i lang="it">stile</i>. You wash the varnish off the plate with a
      sponge of warm oil, but very softly so as not to destroy the
      intaglio. Then you use the plate &amp; stamp impressions on to
      card-board from it in just such a manner as plates done with the
      graver. It is true that this sort of plate is produced very easily,
      but then, you see, they don’t last near so long as those done with
      the graver.</p>

    <p class="drop-capx">Take the gold you wish to refine and beat it
      thin, cut it into little pieces of the size and the thickness of a
      golden scudo. Sometimes the scudi themselves are taken and a
      twenty-four carat cement refined direct from them; and this
      simple<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202"
      class="fnanchor">[202]</a> cement has such virtue that it can draw
      all the alloy<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203"
      class="fnanchor">[203]</a> out of the scudo itself without
      destroying the impression on the coin, but drawing from it only what
      was of base metal.</p>

    <p>The cement is made in this wise: Take tartar and brick dust and
      make a paste of them; construct a round furnace<a id="FNanchor_204"
      href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>, &amp; into the
      joints of the furnace between one brick and another spread the
      paste; put your pieces of gold, or the scudi themselves, if you use
      them, into the paste, and cover them well up with more of it; then
      fire for twenty-four hours, at the end of which time they will be
      refined to twenty-four carats.<a id="FNanchor_205"
      href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

    <p>Know, gentle reader, that this screed of mine is not writ for the
      purpose of teaching such as are refiners<a id="FNanchor_206"
      href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> by profession how to
      make aquafortis, my only care is to show how &amp; to what end it
      may serve the art of goldsmithing; for it came about that having
      made certain golden figures half a cubit high for King Francis, when
      they were near the ending, during the softening in the fire, it
      happened they got a film of lead fumes across them, and had I not
      covered them over with this cement lotion they would have gone
      brittle as glass.<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207"
      class="fnanchor">[207]</a> Then I gave them six hours moderate
      firing, and so in this way freed them from so evil a blemish.</p>

    <h3 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I_ON_THE_ART_OF_BRONZE">CHAPTER I. ON
      THE ART OF CASTING IN BRONZE.</h3>


    <p class="drop-capx">As in other places I have done, so now will I do
      afresh, &amp; in order to give more surety &amp; confidence to him
      that reads this screed of mine, adduce examples from sundry great
      works in bronze that I made for King Francis while in the glorious
      city of Paris. Those bronzes in part I finished, the greater part I
      left imperfect. One of the completed ones was a lunette about eight
      cubits across, made for the gateway of Fontainebleau. For this arch
      I fashioned a statue about seven cubits long in rather more than
      half relief, it was a figure personifying the fountain. Under its
      left arm were vases, from which water seemed to flow, and its right
      arm was posed upon the head of a stag, a great part of whose neck
      was brought out in full relief. On one side of the lunette were a
      number of dogs, that is to say setters
      <a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> &amp; greyhounds; on
      the other side were fashioned stags and wild boar. Above the lunette
      I made two little angels with torches in their hands as signifying
      victory, &amp; over the whole was the salamander, the emblem of the
      King. There was abundance of rich festoonment, and two great satyrs
      for the pilasters of the gate. These latter were not cast, but were
      left in a state ready for casting. The lunette, however, was cast in
      several pieces, &amp; the first and biggest was the nymph of
      Fontainebleau herself.<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209"
      class="fnanchor">[209]</a> Her head &amp; other portions of her body
      stood out in full relief, while the rest were in half relief. The
      way I fashioned her was as follows. I made a model in clay of just
      the size the figure was to be; this done, I estimated that the
      shrinkage would be about one finger’s thickness. So I very carefully
      went over the whole, touching it up and measuring it as the art
      directs.<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210"
      class="fnanchor">[210]</a> Then I gave it a good baking, and after
      that I spread over the whole an even coat<a id="FNanchor_211"
      href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> of wax of less than
      a finger’s thickness, similarly adding wax where I thought it needed
      it, or
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span> even taking a
      little away from off the waxen coat that was over the whole.  This
      method I pursued till I had completed it with infinite diligence and
      care.</p>

    <p>After this I pounded up some ox bone, or rather the burnt core of
      ox horns. It is like a sponge, ignites easily, and is the best bone
      that you can get anywhere. With this I beat up half a similar
      quantity of gesso of tripoli,<a id="FNanchor_212"
      href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> and a fourth part of
      iron filings, &amp; mixed the three things well together with a
      moist solution of dung of horses or kine, which I first passed
      through a fine sieve with fresh water, till the latter took the
      colour of the dung.</p>

    <p>The whole formed a composition which I applied to my model with hog
      sables, arranging the bristles so that their softer and external
      ends formed the end of the sable, and were thus tenderer to work
      with; and so gave the whole figure an equal coating of the
      composition all over, then I let it dry, and similarly gave it two
      more coats, each time letting them dry. These coats were every one
      about the thickness of an ordinary table knife’s back. This done, I
      gave it a coat<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213"
      class="fnanchor">[213]</a> of clay about half a finger thick, let it
      dry, gave it another coat about a finger thick, let that dry too,
      and finally gave it a third, of the same thickness.</p>

      <h3 id="CHAPTER_II_HOW_THE_ABOVE-MENTIONED">CHAPTER
        II. HOW THE ABOVE-MENTIONED CLAY IS MADE.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">The clay you use is made thus: You take such clay
      as is used by the ordnance makers for their moulds. It may be found
      in many places, but preferably near by rivers, for there it has a
      certain sandiness,<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214"
      class="fnanchor">[214]</a> still it must not be too sandy, suffice
      it if it be thin, for the rich clay is delicate and soft, such as is
      used for small figures, cups, plates, and so forth, but not good for
      our purpose. Also you will find it in hills and grottoes,
      particularly round Rome and Florence, and in France at Paris.  The
      clay from the latter city is the finest I ever saw; but as a rule
      the clay from grottoes is better than that from rivers.</p>

    <p>In order to obtain a good result you must let it dry, and sift it
      carefully through a rather coarse sieve in order to get rid of any
      pebbles or bits of root or of glass, &amp; such-like things. Then
      you mix it with cloth frayings, about half as much of the latter as
      you have clay; and take note that here is a wondrous mystery of the
      craft that has never yet been used by any but me.  When the clay and
      the cloth frayings are mixed and bathed with water to the
      consistency of a dough, you beat the mixture up well with a stout
      iron rod about two fingers thick; and, for this is the secret, you
      let it decompose for at least four months or more, the longer the
      better; for then the cloth frayings rot, and owing to this the clay
      gets to be like an unguent.  To those who have not had experience of
      this little trade secret of mine the clay will appear too fatty, but
      this particular kind of fattiness in no wise hinders the accepting
      of the metal,<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215"
      class="fnanchor">[215]</a> indeed it accepts it infinitely better,
      &amp; the clay holds a hundred times more firmly so than if it had
      not rotted. I have used this kind of clay in ever so many most
      difficult works, all of which I shall tell of in their proper
      place.</p>

        III. ANOTHER METHOD OF CASTING FIGURES IN BRONZE OF LIFE SIZE OR A
        LITTLE UNDER.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">Model the figure you wish to cast direct in the
      clay and rag composition above described. Finish your model most
      carefully as regards its proportions and its details of design, in
      fact just as you wish to see it completed. When you have finished
      your figure, working it part in the fresh &amp; part in the dry
      clay, as the art may require, and wishing to cast it in bronze, you
      give it a covering of painter’s foil<a id="FNanchor_216"
      href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> in order to do which
      you first take a certain quantity of turps, heat it in a cauldron or
      pail, and when it is heated to boiling, streak it very carefully all
      over the figure with a hog’s sable, taking heed not to injure a
      single muscle, vein or other subtlety, and so very carefully apply
      your foil. This foil has to be beaten into very fine sheets such as
      the painters use in many places, as for instance on their canvasses
      for painting coats of arms; it is well enough known all the world
      over. Well, you put this foil over the clay figure, and as you have
      to make a mould of gesso over that, you oil the whole figure well
      first. Were it not for the foil it would be but ill protected
      against the humidity and cohesive<a id="FNanchor_217"
      href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> power of the gesso,
      but with the foil it is well protected. In this way you work to
      great advantage, for after the figure is cast in bronze you still
      have your fine original model before you; and many youths &amp; able
      workmen can help you clean the bronze figure up, while if you have
      no model to work to, this cleaning up takes a long time, is little
      to the poor master’s liking, and has but a sorry result.  This was
      what happened to me when I made the Perseus for the most illustrious
      Duke Cosimo, and which may still be seen on his Excellency’s
      piazza. This, which was a figure of more than five cubits high, was
      made in the first of the two described methods; that is to say, it
      was modelled in the clay composition, &amp; finished one finger’s
      thickness under actual size;<a id="FNanchor_218"
      href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> then it was well
      baked, and the coat of wax modelled over it as in the case of the
      nymph of Fontainebleau. After this it was cast all in one piece. In
      order to remove the core<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219"
      class="fnanchor">[219]</a> so that the figure might be lighter, I
      made through the wax a number of holes in the flanks, shoulders, and
      legs, and at such places where I required them; the result of this
      was that the core was kept in its place. Moreover, I put over the
      wax those unguents which
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span> I referred to in
      the case of the nymph of Fontainebleau, then the two or three coats
      of clay, next I bound it round with the iron of which I shall tell
      directly, &amp; then I cast it. This casting was, owing to its size,
      the most difficult casting ever made. But because I am now minded to
      tell of the casting of a smaller figure, I will not muddle things
      too much by leaving my theme. Later on I shall not fail to enter
      upon a little dissertation about my Perseus.</p>

    <figure class="figcenter illowp35" id="perseus" >
      <img class="w100" src="images/i_p114a.jpg" alt="">
      <figcaption class="caption">The Perseus</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Now I have to repeat, then, that the clay figure must have a kind
      of paste spread over it with a very soft paint brush, &amp; little
      by little the foil is laid upon it. This paste is made of flour
      dust, and prepared in the way shoemakers do it, or the mercers, when
      they make barettas &amp; satchels and such like, and you must mind
      to make it very fine and thin, and when you have put the foil in
      little pieces all over it and the whole figure is covered, you can
      make your gesso mould.</p>

    <p>There are divers ways of making the gesso moulds. The best,
      however, that I have come across and that I mostly use myself, is to
      make as many small pieces as when put together would make a complete
      man, and that without any undercutting—as for instance feet, hands,
      head. These small pieces must be made with great care; and while the
      gesso is moist you fit into each of them an iron wire bent double,
      and projecting out of the gesso much like a little ring, so as to be
      capable of holding a thread through it.  Each time that one of these
      small pieces is finished it must be tested, and you must see if you
      get a good impression from it &amp; if the piece relieves.  Then if
      you see that the impression relieves without spoiling a single
      trifle of your work’s delicacy, you put the piece in its place
      again, and with all a good master’s ingenuity take the next piece
      off it, leaving no rift whatever in between them such as would scar
      the work; &amp; so you go on little by little, making the whole
      series of pieces, observing the undercutting and whatever is
      demanded for the head, hands, feet, &amp;c. In this manner you
      carefully make your division right down one half of the figure, I
      mean the half, taken lengthwise, coming over the belly and the
      breasts down to the hips, and from the bottom of them to the half of
      the heels.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220"
      class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Mind, however, that with these small
      pieces the figure is not entirely covered, but leave a part of the
      breasts, a part of the body, a large part of the thighs, and as much
      of the legs. You must take care, too, that the pieces be so placed
      that they may be fitted together as one, but there must be no
      undercutting because over this half figure will have to be cast a
      coat<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221"
      class="fnanchor">[221]</a> of fine gesso more than two fingers
      thick. Before doing this, however, you must mind to cover up with a
      little clay the iron rings which I told you before were to
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span> be put on the small
      pieces, so that in putting on the coat they do not hinder it from
      being lifted off. After this you carefully paint over with a brush
      of olive oil all such parts as shall come in contact with this coat
      in order that when the gesso is set the coat may easily
      relieve. When you have tried a piece to see if it will relieve, put
      it back in its place, and finish the other or back half of the
      figure in the same way as I bade you do the front.  You must be very
      careful when you have finished your mould to take some strong thick
      cord and bind the whole figure together from top to bottom, putting
      a lot of little wedges of wood in order to tighten the rope yet more
      and prevent the gesso from twisting<a id="FNanchor_222"
      href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> and buckling. In
      order not to run any risk of such twisting you keep it thus bound up
      till all the moisture has gone from the gesso. When you see it quite
      dry you unwind the cord and open the mould, and that is your first
      mould.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223"
      class="fnanchor">[223]</a> This in small figures may be of two
      pieces only; when I say small figures I mean life size or less,
      these may be made in two pieces; if they be larger than that you
      must make them in four pieces, <i>i.e.</i>, one piece on each side
      from the top to the navel, &amp; another on each side from the navel
      to the bottom of the figure.  In order to fit better together these
      pieces must overlap the one upon the other a distance of about two
      fingers. This all minutely accomplished, you proceed to open the
      mould and lay it back downwards on the ground, that is to say with
      the concave sides of it facing upwards, and you take off one by one
      all the little pieces sticking to the figure and put them into the
      cavities made by them in the mould;<a id="FNanchor_224"
      href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a> at the same time
      removing the little bits of clay which you put on the iron rings;
      and in every place where the clay has left impressions, bore a hole
      with a small gimlet<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225"
      class="fnanchor">[225]</a> into the mother mould, and attach to each
      iron ring a piece of strong cord. This cord you pass through the
      holes in the mother mould, and tie each piece up in this manner with
      a little splint of wood. When you have thus fitted all your little
      undercut pieces into the mother mould,<a id="FNanchor_226"
      href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> you grease the whole
      mould with soft lard, &amp; proceed to give it what is technically
      termed the <i lang="it">lasagna</i>, which is a cake about a good
      knife’s back thick of wax or clay or paste.</p>

    <p>This is made thus: you take a piece of wood and with the chisels
      cut out in it a square cavity the shape of a man’s palm and of the
      depth of a good knife’s back, more or less, in accordance with the
      thickness your figure is to have. Then you keep squeezing your cake
      (or <i lang="it">lasagna</i>) into this wooden shape, &amp; apply it
      to the gesso mould of your figure so as to let one piece touch the
      other. Then you lay the two halves together on the ground side
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span> by side, and
      construct an iron framework which serves as a skeleton for the
      figure, and this must be made tortuously and in accordance with the
      direction of the legs, arms, torso, &amp; head of the figure. This
      done, you take clay beaten together with shavings of cloth—the thin
      clay of which I told you before<a id="FNanchor_227"
      href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>—and little by little
      fit it round the skeleton, letting it dry, now by patient waiting,
      now by holding it before the fire, till the whole of your mould is
      filled. Then you test the two parts by repeatedly applying the one
      to the other. When this framework of earth and iron, which is called
      the kernel, <i lang="it">nocciolo</i>, fills the figure so
      completely as to tally all round with the
      <i lang="it">lasagna</i>, you take it out, bind it round with thin
      iron wire from head to foot and give it a good firing. Then you
      streak it over with a thin solution made of powdered bone and thin
      brick dust mixed with a little of the clay and cloth frayings, and
      apply it again to a rather slighter fire, this time so that the
      solution shall also be fired, then you take
      the <i lang="it">lasagna</i> out of your mould. You must be very
      careful, too, to leave some pieces of the iron skeleton sticking out
      in at least four places, for they will keep the kernel from
      shifting, and these projections must tally with the gesso
      mould. When the
      <i lang="it">lasagna</i> is removed you once more grease the gesso
      mould with fat, a little soft bacon fat is best, and it is also well
      to have it warm, for then it combines better with the gesso.</p>

    <p>Then you make the inlet holes in which you want to pour your wax,
      and fit the kernel into the mould; then stand the figure up straight
      &amp; make at least four vent holes, two at the feet and two at the
      hands, the more you make the surer you will be to fill your figure
      with wax.</p>

    <p>The vent holes you make thus. The first two you place right at the
      very bottom of the feet, and it will be better for you to set your
      figure on a little eminence in order to do this more easily. You
      must take a stout gimlet,<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228"
      class="fnanchor">[228]</a> and carefully bore a hole with it, and
      this is best done if slanting downwards, and see that you leave no
      fragments in the mould as you do it. When you have made these holes,
      you take a number of canes, which you skilfully bend, &amp; so fit
      together that they start from the holes below and turn up straight
      alongside the figure, binding one cane to another &amp; all together
      into one up towards to the top of the figure. You must be careful,
      too, wherever the bits of cane join, and wherever they fit into the
      holes, to smear them well round with a little moist clay so as to
      prevent the wax from oozing out.</p>

    <p>After this you can heat your wax, &amp;, when it is well molten,
      pour it in.  This process now can be easily effected, however
      difficult the pose of the
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span> figure may be, if
      you observe the various little hints I have given you, &amp; above
      all give heed to the vent holes at the base. After you have filled
      it with wax let it thoroughly cool for a whole day—if it be summer,
      say two days. Then undo the bindings with great care; &amp; loosen
      all the little bits of string that tie the pieces together within,
      and are made for the undercuttings as I so carefully explained to
      you before. When you have uncovered the one half, you may
      complacently begin to try it from either front or back; &amp; I tell
      you this, the fact of your having let the wax stand for that day or
      two according to the season of the year, will cause a slight
      shrinkage in the wax of about the space of a horse’s hair, and so
      you will find it quite easy to remove this first piece from your
      figure. Then lay it down, and proceed to do the like to the next
      piece, &amp; you will do well to lay both on long narrow benches, so
      that you can get underneath them with your hands.</p>

    <p>After this you remove from the figure all the pieces of the mould
      attached with the bits of string through the iron rings one by one
      ever so carefully, and you polish &amp; remove very nicely all the
      rough edges that may have been left on the figure by reason of the
      joinings of all the different pieces, and in this manner you touch
      up the whole. In doing this, moreover, if you are minded to add any
      subtle labour or fancy to your work, you are easily able to do
      it. After this<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229"
      class="fnanchor">[229]</a> you fashion in wax, just as you erst made
      them for the earthen mould<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230"
      class="fnanchor">[230]</a> all the vent holes for the bronze
      casting, &amp; mind that they all slant downwards to the bottom;
      later when the figure has its last &amp; earthen mould on, these
      vents may easily be turned up with clay. The method of doing this I
      shall describe minutely later as soon as I have shown how all the
      different coatings<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231"
      class="fnanchor">[231]</a> from first to last are applied, the mould
      bound up and the wax emptied out.</p>

    <p>Here all I want to insist on is that the vents must be made to bend
      towards the bottom, because, when that is the case, the wax is more
      easily melted out; if they were otherwise you would have to turn the
      mould up and down, which would give trouble, &amp; you would run
      risk of spoiling it. But if you do it as I tell, you are absolutely
      safe. Then note this too, it is of the utmost importance that in
      melting out the wax your fire be so tempered that the wax does not
      boil in the mould, but comes out with the greatest patience. When
      the wax is all out give the mould yet another but very moderate
      firing, in order to get rid of any moisture that may be left in the
      mould. Then you may give it a regular good firing, first casing the
      mould in a coat of bricks set one above the other, &amp; at about a
      three fingers’ distance from the mould; this firing should
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span> be of soft wood,
      such as elder, lime, beech or twigs. Any green wood, or the wood of
      the oak, is to be avoided, and use no charcoal whatever, because all
      these fuse the clay and make it become like glass. There are some
      earths that do not thus cohere, and such are used in glass &amp;
      bronze furnaces. I shall not fail in the proper place to tell you of
      these, but at present let me continue my narration of how to prepare
      our mould for the casting of the bronze.</p>

    <p>Dig a pit near your furnace in front of the plug at the outlet
      hole,<a id="FNanchor_232_1"  href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> 
      which pit should be so big as not only to contain your
      figure, but also be half a cubit deeper, and in order that you can
      give the proper fall, the mouth or inlet hole<a id="FNanchor_233_1"
      href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a> must be at least
      a quarter of a cubit above the head of your figure. So also as in
      the case of its depth, the pit should be half a cubit larger in
      width than would be needed to hold the mould. Then take the mould
      out of the bricks in which you baked it, and when it is cool bind it
      very carefully with a rope which should be strong enough to carry
      it, then fasten a pulley to a beam in the roof, &amp; the rope
      through the pulley, and see that you provide a windlass sufficiently
      strong to lift your figure.  As I don’t want to omit certain little
      details, which may be well learnt from experience, I may mention
      that when I made my Perseus, for that the work was so very large, I
      lowered it into the pit with two windlasses, which were weighted
      with more than 2,000 lbs., but a small figure of three cubits would
      not need more than one. ’Tis true you might do without any windlass
      at all for the latter, but that would be very risky, because it
      might tend to move the kernel of the mould, that is the
      core<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234"
      class="fnanchor">[234]</a> or inner block, or again it might knock
      the shell<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235"
      class="fnanchor">[235]</a> outside it. The windlass obviates this
      danger. And so you very very gently hoist the figure up, &amp; move
      it to the mouth of the pit, &amp; with equal care you unwind the
      windlass and lower it to the bottom.</p>

    <p>When the figure is standing in position, with the inlet
      hole<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233"
      class="fnanchor">[233]</a> in a line with the
      plugs<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236"
      class="fnanchor">[236]</a> at the outlet hole,<a id="FNanchor_232"
      href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> the first thing you
      have to do is to fit on to the vent holes certain tubes of baked
      clay such as are used for water-pipes. Of these there are plenty to
      be got in Florence, so that I was provided, and I used some of them
      bent, &amp; those for the bottom pieces, and in all such instances
      when the vents were turned downwards; and fitting one tube on to
      another, I brought them into one straight line upwards.</p>

    <p>This done, you take the earth you dug out of the trench and sift it
      well; then mix it with sand, which, however, ought not to be too
      soft, with
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span> this mixture you
      fill up the pit. The mixture of sand &amp; earth it may be observed
      need only surround the figure to the extent of a quarter of a cubit,
      for the rest, the plain unsifted earth as you dug it out of the
      trench, will suffice to fill up the remainder of the cavity. When
      the earth has been piled in to the extent of about one-third of a
      cubit, you go into the pit with two rammers,<a id="FNanchor_237"
      href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> which are a kind of
      wooden instrument three cubits long &amp; about a quarter of a cubit
      broad at the bottom. And with these you pound the earth and weld it
      well together. In doing this you must take great care in no way to
      knock at the mould, it will be quite sufficient if you come within
      four fingers of it, and instead of the rammers, press it with your
      feet, still take great care not to shake the mould.  This ramming in
      you will repeat every time you have shovelled another third of a
      cubit of earth into the pit. Every time, too, that the earth fills
      up to the level of the top of the vents, take another of the terra
      cotta pipes and add it on, binding the juncture round well with a
      little clean tow in order to prevent the earth getting into the
      vents, for that would stop the passage of air and so hinder your
      figure from coming. In this way, taking heed of the vents as you
      fill in the earth, you pass from base to legs, from legs to flanks,
      from flanks to arms, till at last you get earth and vents on a level
      with the top of your pit. Then you proceed to make the
      passage<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238"
      class="fnanchor">[238]</a> down which the bronze is to flow. Also
      you must take care that as soon as you begin putting your figure
      into the trench, you begin at the same time to fill your furnace
      with the bronze and heat it, so that your mould shall not get damp
      from too long standing. All these things if they be not observed
      ofttimes prevent the mould from filling.</p>

    <p>When the pit is filled up to the mouth of the main
      entrance<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239"
      class="fnanchor">[239]</a> where the bronze is to be poured in, and
      also having allowed for the necessary fall from the mouth of the
      plug<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240"
      class="fnanchor">[240]</a> whence the bronze is to issue from the
      furnace, &amp; having carried up all the vents as described, you
      keep both them and the mouth of the main entrance carefully plugged
      with a little tow.  Then you take a lot of square tiles and make a
      pavement of them round the vents. As there will be more than one
      entrance channel for your bronze, you must take note that the
      flooring in question comes right up to the ingress holes of the
      bronze. Then you take bits of hard dry bricks broken up into pieces
      of three fingers or more in thickness, according to your cunning
      master’s discretion and according to the fall your bronze may need,
      &amp; then these bricks you plaster together with liquid clay and
      cloth shavings in lieu of mortar, on the top of your flooring. Note
      further, that of these same bricks you construct a channel from the
      wall of
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span> your furnace and
      running right round the ingress holes of your figure.</p>

    <p>Then you take bricks, baked or unbaked (the latter are better,
      though there’s not much difference)<a id="FNanchor_241"
      href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> and wall up the
      channel to the requisite height, the thickness of a brick wall will
      suffice. You construct it by laying brick upon brick &amp; making
      the height of the wall equal the width of the
      channel.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242"
      class="fnanchor">[242]</a> When you have carefully joined together
      with your moist clay instead of mortar all the cracks through which
      the bronze might ooze out, you remove the tow plugs in the ingress
      holes of the bronze, and in their stead fit some easily removable
      stops of moist clay made so that you can take them out without
      difficulty, for you have almost immediately to bring glowing coals
      into your channel, and with these you cover all the parts that have
      been walled up with clay till they are well dried, and the fire must
      be renewed several times till they are not only well-dried but
      baked.</p>

    <p>When all this is accomplished, and your metal meanwhile has got
      well fused, carefully blow with the bellows all the ash and cinders
      out of the channel, till none remains to hinder the passage of the
      metal; then take out all the plugs that close the vent holes, and
      the earthen stoppers in the ingress holes, &amp; throw some two or
      three tallow candles, under one pound in weight, into the
      channel. Hereupon run to the mouth of your furnace and refresh it
      with a certain quantity of pewter of rather more than the ordinary
      alloy, <i>i.e.</i>, half a pound per cent. (<i>i.e.</i>, of
      bronze)<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243"
      class="fnanchor">[243]</a> more than what you have hitherto
      used. When this has been very rapidly done, heap up more and more
      fire of green wood in your furnace, and then with your iron crook
      (<i lang="it">mandriano</i>) for thus the instrument is called,
      boldly strike away the plug of the furnace, &amp; let the bronze
      run; gently at first, holding a point of the iron crook in the mouth
      of the plug, till a certain quantity of the metal has run forth,
      &amp; its first fury be spent, for if you did not do this you might
      run the risk of your mould being stopped up with wind. Then you can
      remove the iron crook from the mouth of the plug and let all the
      bronze go till the furnace be emptied. To this end it is necessary
      to have a man standing at each of the furnace mouths,
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span> who, with the
      scraping iron<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244"
      class="fnanchor">[244]</a> which is used in the craft, drives the
      bronze towards the outlet, until all is cleared out. Such of the
      flowing metal as is still left after your mould is filled you dam by
      means of throwing on to it with a shovel some of the earth you
      erstwhile dug out of the trench.  That is how you complete your
      mould.</p>

    <p>Not to be omitted are divers and terrible mishaps that occur from
      time to time, and often bring to nought all the poor master’s
      pains. So ’tis a wise thing to profit in good time by the experience
      of others. Ofttimes we figure casters call in the help of ordnance
      founders<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245"
      class="fnanchor">[245]</a> to aid us, but the most terrible
      misfortunes not infrequently occur owing to their insufficient
      experience and want of care, and all our labour is lost. Just such a
      thing very nearly happened to me when I was casting my Perseus, for,
      calling to aid some of those fellows, I found them so absolutely
      devoid of sense that in their stupidity they all swore my mould was
      spoilt, and that there was no means of righting it, and all this
      thanks to the muddle they themselves had made with my
      metal.<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246"
      class="fnanchor">[246]</a> The statue was more than five cubits high
      &amp; its pose was a difficult one, for in its left hand it held
      raised aloft the head of Medusa, in the hair of which was much rich
      detail of serpents; while the right hand was held behind in a
      vigorous action, &amp; the left leg was bent. All this variety of
      limbs made the casting most difficult, and for this reason I was
      ever so keen to get it good, and also because it would be the first
      big work I had produced in Italy, my fatherland, &amp; the veritable
      school of all the arts. So I was moved to even greater pains and
      diligence than I had before used to complete my figure well.  So,
      therefore, I set to making a great number of air vents, and ever so
      many flowing-in mouths that all diverged from one main one, the
      which ran down at the back of the figure from the height of the head
      down to both heels and spreading out a bit at the calves. All these
      little hints are part of the craft, and in this manner did I
      practise it when I wrought in France. As I had to do almost
      everything with my own hand, owing to the intense bodily fatigue to
      which I was subjected a violent fever seized upon me. I struggled
      against it for many hours, but in the end it floored me, and I was
      brought to bed. As I had those different masters of ordnance and
      statuary founders working for me, I explained to them before I laid
      me down, exactly the methods I had begun, and how these were now
      perfectly easy to understand, as more than half the figure was
      already covered, &amp; the greater part of the difficulties
      surmounted. All that they had to do was to follow my instructions in
      detail, and that appeared easy enough, so, being
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span> utterly incapable
      of holding out any longer, I flung myself on my couch.</p>

    <p>Meantime the men worked at my furnace which I had so well prepared
      and in which the bronze was nearly molten<a id="FNanchor_247"
      href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> and ready for
      completing.  Now they had a good six hours’ work still to employ
      them in order to fulfil all my instructions in proper sequence,
      because they were not quite skilled in the technique of the craft,
      and because my methods were different from those they usually
      employed. Well, instead of doing what they were told they began
      larking about, neglected the furnace so that the metal commenced to
      curdle, or, as it is called in the craft, to
      cake, <i lang="it">migliaccio</i> they call it in their lingo. Nary
      a one knew a remedy for this blunder, for in a round furnace like
      this one the action of the fire upon the metal is from above, were
      it from below it would be easy enough to heat the curdled metal
      again; so not one of them knew a remedy. Then as I lay there
      prostrate on my bed with fever, one of them in whom I had a little
      more confidence than the rest, came to me, and speaking very gently,
      said: ‘Benvenuto, resign yourself to the worst, the furnace has been
      ill prepared,<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248"
      class="fnanchor">[248]</a> a cake has formed on the metal.’</p>

    <p>Then I turned myself toward him and had all the other craftsmen
      summoned in whom I put any confidence, and asked them if they knew
      any remedy. Whereupon these precious fine fellows said there was no
      other remedy but to break up the furnace, &amp; in so doing, as the
      mould was buried six cubits in the ground, they could not see (they
      said) how the mould could help being spoiled. For even if I tried to
      dig up the ground round it, which had been plugged fast, there were
      so many ingress holes &amp; vents that it was dead certain to be
      spoiled. That, forsooth, was the only remedy they had!</p>

    <p>Now, gentle reader, picture to yourself my state,—I in all my ills
      &amp; sickness—this new trouble thrust upon me—all my honour at
      stake—why I felt the keenest grief that ever man could imagine! But
      this was no time to give way to grief. Suddenly, as in a frenzy, my
      old inborn daring came upon me; it’s not a thing one can learn,
      this! it’s in a man’s nature! Furiously I leapt from my bed &amp;
      literally frightened away that grievous fever with the biting words
      I shouted at those fellows.</p>

    <p>‘Oh you good-for-nothings! who not only know nought, but have
      brought to nought all my splendid labours, at least keep your heads
      on your shoulders now and obey me; for from my knowledge of the
      craft I can bring to life what you have given up for dead, if only
      the sickness that is upon me shall not crush out my body’s vigour.’
      Thus hounding them on I ran with
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span> them into the
      workshop, and in one go ordered six of them to different
      duties. First I bade one of them fetch me a load of dry oak that was
      stacked opposite the house of Capretta, the butcher; &amp; as soon
      as this came I began throwing it into the furnace several pieces at
      a time. Now, though I’ve said it once before—as it’s so very
      important I’m going to tell it you again, &amp; it’s this: in bronze
      furnaces the only woods you use are elder, willow, and pine, for all
      these are soft woods; in this particular instance, however, I used
      oak, because I wanted the greatest possible heat, and thus the metal
      began to move at once. To two others I bade with long iron rods to
      keep poking into the furnace mouths because it was storming with
      wind, and raining cats and dogs, &amp; wind and rain was blowing
      into my furnace; by these means I showed them how to stave off wind
      &amp; rain. Two others I set to work to quench the fire, because a
      part of the workshop had caught alight, and several great wooden
      windows were blazing like the devil, so that I was in terror lest
      the whole roof should be aflame, so tremendous was the fire. With
      the others, and there were plenty of them, I set to work clearing
      the channels, through which the metal was to run, and to opening all
      the vent holes. Scarce was this done when, all on a sudden, just as
      the work was being completed, owing to the terrific heat of the
      burning oak, the whole cap of the furnace was blown up into the air,
      and the metal began to well over on all sides; they stood in utter
      astonishment, all of them,—for they had obeyed me fearsomely—to see
      the caked metal thus again liquified. The strength of the fire,
      however, had consumed all the tin alloy, so I ordered to be thrown
      in a thick pig of fine pewter. When I saw this was of no avail, and
      that by God’s grace the metal was already beginning to flow &amp; to
      spread itself on the sides of the furnace, I ordered two others to
      run into my house and fetch hither all my pewter plates and dishes,
      200 lbs. weight in all, and threw them in bit by bit. Then I made
      another take iron crooks and strike out first one &amp; then the
      second of the plugs, which were very hard. Then, as the metal began
      to flow through the channels, I, little by little, threw the thin
      pewter plates into it, which, owing to the immense heat, combined
      with the other pewter, so that my mould was soon filled. Seeing all
      this mass of metal run in so well without any bubbling or even a
      single hitch, I concluded that all my vents were doing their
      work. The amount of metal left over just corresponded exactly to the
      extra quantity thrown in, so that my mould was completely
      filled. When this was accomplished I gave thanks to God, and turning
      to the lot of them, said: ‘D’ye see how everything has its remedy?’
      Spite of the pain such was my delight that I felt no more fatigue;
      the fever just went to the devil, &amp; I sat down to eat and drink
      with a light heart, together with all the lot of them, and everyone
      marvelled thereat.</p>

    <p>Once, too, in France, when serving King Francis, &amp; being
      anxious to cast
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span> a lunette of over
      six cubits in diameter, and containing numbers of figures and
      animals, and other things, much the same occurred owing to a like
      blundering of my assistants. For although the founders in those
      parts, especially in &amp; around Lutezia, where they turn out more
      of it than in any other place under the sun, are safer in their
      technique than any others, still, as they are deficient in the
      fundamental principles of the art, they lose their heads and give
      all up in despair when anything exceptional occurs. I anticipated a
      similar accident to that which I have just described with my Perseus
      on another eventful occasion; for, though the incidents were very
      different, there happened to be one thing that differed from
      customary methods.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249"
      class="fnanchor">[249]</a> My people were all in despair, and even I
      myself was much troubled at seeing them so, but with my wonted
      pluck, and owing to my thorough knowledge of the art I was here
      again able to bring a dead horse to life.
      <a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> When those ancient
      masters of the art (who were present on that occasion) saw this they
      blessed the day and the hour that they made my acquaintance; though
      I, who was their pupil, knew well that it really depended upon what
      I had learnt from them. They worked according to
      tradition,<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251"
      class="fnanchor">[251]</a> this tradition I mastered; and I will
      gladly describe the rule on which it was based, and how this rule
      stood me in stead.</p>

    <p>But let us return somewhat in order to continue the course of our
      narration.  For though we have digressed a bit we have not diverged
      from the method of our subject, and can easily return to it. We have
      shown how the mould is made and the casting done, and we have
      evidenced this with a statue about three cubits in size; there yet
      remains another method, in itself much easier, but not so safe as
      the above-mentioned one. The point of this is that instead of making
      the core<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252"
      class="fnanchor">[252]</a> of your figure in clay, you make it of
      gesso mixed with burnt bone and pounded brick. Provided the gesso be
      of good quality this method is more easy to practise, because
      instead of applying one coat after another, as you do in the clay
      method, you can make the gesso liquid; that is to say, having
      combined the ingredients just stated, one portion of gesso &amp; an
      equal portion of bone and brick, you make a sort of paste of it
      which you pour into the mould over the solution
      (<i lang="it">lasagna</i>) and which soon sets.</p>

    <p>After this, having taken off the mould,
      <a id="FNanchor_253"  href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> you bind the core
      well round with iron wire, and cover this very carefully with a
      similar coat of paste, only rather more liquid. This done, the core
      is well baked in the same way as the earthen one was in the previous
      method,
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span> and the wax poured
      over it into the mould just as described above.</p>

    <p>When the mould is removed the wax is cleaned round and the air
      vents arranged also just as before described, then you case the
      whole over with a shell of gesso also as before. When this shell is
      completed to the thickness of about two-and-a-half fingers, you bind
      it all round with the same bands of iron two fingers wide, &amp;
      then once again cover it all over with another coat of gesso.</p>

    <p>After this the figure is placed in a furnace made entirely of
      bricks, &amp; so arranged that when the fire is lighted the wax can
      be melted out into a receptacle set in a hole in the ground beneath
      the furnace, the wax flowing through the air vents, and these vents
      arranged in the manner above stated. When the wax is out you make up
      a good fire of wood and charcoal till the outer
      mould<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254"
      class="fnanchor">[254]</a> of your figure is well baked, but you may
      take note that the gesso does not need near so strong a fire as the
      clay. True it is that the gesso in our part of Tuscany does not lend
      itself so well to works of this nature as that of Mantua, Milan and
      France. Several very able youths who have worked for his Excellency
      the Duke of Florence, have been taken in not once but two or three
      times, owing to the delusion that ours was the best way of making
      gesso. The most excellent Duke, who was ever a lover of
      thoroughness, very thoughtfully had patience with them, but our
      young men, unacquainted with the difference between the one gesso
      and the other, stuck to their own method, &amp; remained
      unenlightened. From this you may take note that when a master wants
      to do a work he should make trial, not only of his clays and his
      gessos, but of all the things he proposes to use. In this way alone
      will he get credit by his work, and in no other way. In this
      connection I may make mention of the sorts of lime I have seen in
      Rome, in France, and in other parts of the world. The lime that
      keeps longest in the slacked state is the best &amp; makes the
      firmest composition, but our Florentine lime ought to be used
      immediately after slacking; if this is done it makes the best lime
      and the firmest composition in the world, but it loses its virtue if
      left standing; with the foreign lime, however, the reverse
      obtains.</p>

      <h3 id="CHAPTER_IV_HOW_TO_CONSTRUCT">CHAPTER IV. HOW
        TO CONSTRUCT FURNACES FOR CASTING BRONZE, WHETHER FOR STATUES,
        ORDNANCE, OR OTHER SUCH-LIKE THINGS.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">Furnaces for casting bronze have to be made by
      each master according as the special needs of his piece of work
      require it. Inasmuch as at the beginning of my book I promised
      always to illustrate what I was describing by work of my own, I will
      do so with furnaces also. When working for good King Francis, I had
      to make a great bronze gate, for which a special furnace had to be
      constructed. This I did in my own castle, given to me in royal
      letters patent by his Majesty, whom I served most loyally for four
      years; and these letters patent I brought back with me to Florence,
      if only to show in Italy &amp; my native land what great treasures
      may not be acquired, and how good it is after having been trained in
      Italy to leave home, and reap such useful &amp; honourable fruits
      abroad.</p>

    <p>Well, then, having to make a furnace, this was the way I did
      it. The hollow within was three Florentine cubits wide, which made
      it about nine cubits in circumference, the height of the vault of
      the furnace was equal in size and shape to the half circle of the
      bed.<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255"
      class="fnanchor">[255]</a> To this bed, most gentle reader, I want
      you to give special attention; I do not intend making a drawing of
      it, because I have seen so many architectural drawings altered and
      spoiled, so I shall content myself with words only to convey what I
      mean, and such as I trust may suffice.
      <a id="FNanchor_256"  href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> In a furnace of this
      nature, the bed, <i>i.e.</i> the place where the metal is put, must
      be constructed with a fall, just as I made the little one in
      question. The total fall to the bottom of the bed should be about
      one-sixth of a cubit, and see that it is shaped in the manner of the
      streets you go a-walking in that have in the middle of them what in
      Tuscany we call a <i lang="it">rigaguolo</i> or gulley; this gulley
      runs direct to the mouth of the outlet hole out of which the metal
      is to flow. The shoulders<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257"
      class="fnanchor">[257]</a> of the gulley should slope up ever so
      gently, till they come to within about one-third of a cubit at the
      two gates<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258"
      class="fnanchor">[258]</a> where you put the bronze. This third you
      can increase or not by one-sixteenth
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span> of a cubit
      according to whether you wish to increase or decrease the depth of
      your furnace. The third door, about which you need not be so
      particular, is the one through which the fire enters, &amp;, as it
      is not brought into direct connection with the bronze, it need only
      be blocked with a little mound of earth about three fingers
      high. The bed of your furnace should be of bricks, specially
      constructed, they should be small, but bigger at one end than the
      other, &amp; measuring one-sixth of a cubit in either direction; by
      far the best are those used for glass furnaces, which are made much
      in the same way as other bricks. Some have shaped their bricks with
      a cutting instrument<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259"
      class="fnanchor">[259]</a> as they went along, but I find, after
      having tried one way &amp; another, that the best results can be
      obtained by having them all the same size. Care should be taken to
      make the bricks of a clay that does not yield in the fire; in my
      native city of Florence we use a kind of white clay, said to come
      from Monte Carlo, and all our glass furnaces were constructed with
      it. In France I found another and ever so much better way. The
      bricks are one-fourth of a cubit long, &amp; the same width as the
      above, they call them <i lang="it">ciment</i>, and they make them
      out of crucibles used in founderies, of which there are no end in
      those parts. But your master has got to <ins class="corr" id="accommodate"
      title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: accomodate">accommodate</ins> himself to the
      conditions of workmanship in every place he works in. When your
      bricks are thus made, they must when quite dry, be carefully worked
      over with iron tools, somewhat in the nature of axes or large
      chisels made specially for the purpose, so as to make them cohere as
      well as possible. After this they are gradually cemented with quarry
      stones<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260"
      class="fnanchor">[260]</a> to the thickness of about half a cubit,
      so that you get an absolutely firm floor for your furnace. These
      quarry stones should be at least one-third of a cubit in size, and
      ever so firmly united.  The first or lower part of a furnace of this
      description should be, in diameter two-thirds of a cubit larger than
      the upper portion. Both must be walled with ordinary lime, provided
      it be good, and after the lower, you proceed to wall the upper, the
      portion in which the bronze has to be placed.</p>

    <p>Having fashioned your bricks out of the fire-resisting earth just
      referred to, you take some of this earth, and make a paste of it as
      you would of lime, minding however, that it is well sifted and
      clean, and with it wall the whole base of your furnace. I insist
      again upon the need of your working over the bricks with your
      chisels carefully, &amp; smoothing them well, so that they fit
      together absolutely, and in thus fitting them, you must make the
      jointings as thin as possible. Sometimes it happens, owing to
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span> some little
      negligence on the master’s part, if he mix the liquid earth too
      coarsely, that the tiniest little cracks form in the drying. These
      cracks, however small they be, are mighty dangerous, &amp; may cause
      incalculable mischief; for, when the bronze grows liquid, such is
      its terrific force, that it penetrates into them, be they never so
      small, and I myself have seen the whole thing burst up owing to
      this.<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261"
      class="fnanchor">[261]</a> But when due care is observed, &amp; the
      walling made with the finest possible liquid earth, there is no need
      for cracks, your bronze may be safely melted, and all your work come
      scatheless from the furnace.</p>

    <p>After the bed you build up the vault with similar bricks in the
      same way, in doing which you must remember, as I said before, to
      make your two openings for putting in the bronze; two-thirds of a
      cubit wide and three-quarters of a cubit high will suffice them, and
      they must be semi-circular atop. There must also be a third opening
      two-thirds of a cubit wide and one cubit high for the fire to enter
      in at, so that the flame, as is its wont, may curl powerfully to the
      top of the vault, and thence curl down again,
      <a id="FNanchor_262"  href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> and with great heat
      play upon the metal, &amp; melt it rapidly. Four air vents have to
      be distributed round the spring of the top of the furnace
      vault.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p>

    <p>In one of the vault bricks, at the lower end of the channel, a
      mouth must be made much like the air vents, &amp; big enough for you
      to put in two fingers quite comfortably. The air vent too must be
      the same size. This mouth, out of which the bronze is to flow, must
      be made from one brick; &amp; mind that it is a good sound one. The
      said brick, too, must, moreover, be built into its place just as the
      others were, and helping with them to gradually lock in the vault at
      the top. So that you don’t think me inaccurate, I would have you
      know that this mouth is called <i lang="it">bocca della spina</i>,
      the mouth of the plug; it must be half a finger wider inside than
      out, and before you pour out the metal you keep it stopped with an
      iron stopper luted with a little ash made into a kind of paste. Then
      you take a quarry stone about half a cubit square &amp; make a hole
      through the middle of it. This hole is to be exactly the size of the
      mouth just made in the brick, that is to say on the side adjoining
      the brick, but on the other side, the side away from the furnace, it
      is to be six times as big, and it should be cleaned
      off<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264"
      class="fnanchor">[264]</a> outside. Then you join it to the
      brickwork wall of the furnace with the earth, &amp; in the manner
      mentioned above; but because the base and sides of the furnace have
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span> also to be
      considered, as I said before, you cement these with good ordinary
      lime. Similarly all the quarry stones must be the same size as the
      first piece, and be attached to the walling in the same manner,
      &amp; they must be carried up to the height of the vault, but
      straight; so that in the event of any accident happening to the
      vault, for to that the craft is often liable, it may be mended or
      put in order. When you have walled your furnace round in this way
      you must be careful to join at the shoulders
      <a id="FNanchor_265"  href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> of the principal
      orifice, by which the flame enters,
      <a id="FNanchor_266"  href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> a hearth two-thirds
      of a cubit square &amp; two cubits deep, measured from the bottom of
      this hole of the hearth. In this cavity you put six or seven iron
      bars, these are about two fingers thick, &amp; of such length as to
      project beyond the sides of the hole about four fingers each way,
      and they rest upon pins set at intervals of about three fingers
      apart. This hearth made over the fire bars is constructed in just
      the same way, &amp; with just the same bricks, and cemented with
      just the same mortar as was the furnace; it must stand from the
      ground to about the middle of the hole where the fire enters the
      fire bridge, and the part above this point must be narrowed to
      one-eighth of a cubit. Straight through this hole the wood is
      put. Under the grating a trench must be dug, &amp; five or six
      cubits long, in the direction in which the draught is to pass
      through the grating into the hearth. Care must be taken that the
      draught only blows in one way, and that long-ways. We craftsmen call
      this trench
      <i lang="it">bracciaiuola</i>, the ash-pit, because all the ashes
      fall into it. How long the fire is to be kept up must be a matter of
      judgment; sometimes the master may have, owing to work he has to do
      on his mould, to keep it up for quite four or six hours. When the
      wood logs are burnt through, they fall into a great pile below the
      grating. And sometimes they heap up in such a way as to obstruct the
      force of the draught through the hearth, that it cannot do its work;
      heed must be taken then, that when the pile begins to grow big, the
      ashes must be raked asunder from time to time. To do this, you must
      have what we call a <i lang="it">rastrello</i> or rake, which you
      make as follows. You take a piece of iron half a cubit long and
      one-eighth of a cubit thick; on to the middle of this piece and at
      the upper and thicker side of it you weld an iron rod two fingers
      thick and two cubits long, at the other end of this is fashioned a
      ferule,<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267"
      class="fnanchor">[267]</a> into which is fitted a wooden handle at
      least four cubits long.</p>

    <p>Take heed, too, that when your whole furnace is duly made as above
      directed, you gird it round with two stout iron bands, the one round
      near the base, the other about one-third of a cubit higher up; the
      thicker and
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span> stouter these hoops
      are, the better, for I know by the experience of the casting of my
      Perseus how terrific the might of the fire is. The opening of the
      hearth through which the wood is put must be kept closed. The
      covering must be made in the form of an iron spade, of such a size
      as shall well cover the opening, and to this spade a handle of such
      convenient length that when, now and again, you have to manipulate
      it for putting on fresh wood or otherwise, you don’t burn
      yourself. It stands to reason that before all these things are
      accomplished, the metal has already been put in the furnace, &amp;
      it must be stacked up in such a manner as to admit of flames playing
      easily through it, for this will make the working of your furnace
      much more effective.</p>

    <p>Know, too, gentle reader, what up to now I have forgotten to tell
      you, that when with due care your furnace is made, you must, before
      putting the metal into it, heat it well through for a space of
      twenty-four hours; for if you do not do this, you will not get the
      metal to melt, nay rather will it stiffen,
      <a id="FNanchor_268"   href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> and certain fumes
      will result from the damp earth that will so impede your work that
      it may be eight days before your metal begins to flow. That is what
      happened to me in Paris. I had made a little furnace and had put my
      trust in a very excellent old fellow, quite the best of his craft
      and about eighty years of age; but he hadn’t dried the furnace
      properly, and, sure enough, just as it was on the point of melting,
      &amp; the fire at its fiercest, out came these earth fumes. When the
      old worthy saw that for all his heeding the metal was stiffening, he
      got into such a stew, the poor old chap, that what with his mighty
      exertions to overcome the difficulty, he fell flat down, and I took
      him for certain dead. Howbeit I had a great beaker of the choicest
      wine brought him, &amp; since there was no such great risk in
      leaving the work as there was in the case of my Perseus; since, too,
      I served that most admirable of kings, and thus had not to bother so
      much about the peddling trivialities of making it pay, for however
      big it was it never mattered with him—I mixed a large bumper of wine
      for the old man, who was groaning away like anything, and I bade him
      most winning-wise to drink, &amp; I stretched out my hand to him and
      said: ‘Drink, my father, for in yonder furnace has entered in a
      devil, who is making all the mischief, and, look you, we’ll just let
      him bide there a couple of days, till he gets jolly well bored, and
      then will we, you and I together, in the space of a three hours’
      firing make this metal run like so much butter, &amp; without any
      exertion at all.’ The old fellow drank, &amp; then I brought him
      some little dainties to eat, meat pasties they were,
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span> nicely peppered,
      and I made him take down four full goblets of wine. He was a man
      quite out of the ordinary, this, and a most lovable old thing, and
      what with my caresses and the virtue of the wine, I found him soon
      moaning away as much with joy as he had moaned before with grief.
      When the appointed day came the fumes had duly evaporated, the
      furnace was quite ready and well heated, &amp; in two hours we cast
      1500 lbs.  of metal, with which I finished certain portions that
      were left of my lunette of Fontainebleau. And that is why I insist
      upon your well heating the furnace, and also upon making two little
      quarry stone doors<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269"
      class="fnanchor">[269]</a> at the furnace openings, and you make in
      each of them two holes one and a half fingers wide respectively, and
      four fingers apart from each other, and these holes serve for the
      insertion of an iron fork made specially to fit into them, with
      which now and again, as need occurs, you may open &amp; shut the
      doors.</p>

    <p>Remember, too, that each time new metal is to be put into the
      furnace it must be first put up against the
      doors<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270"
      class="fnanchor">[270]</a> till it becomes red hot, for if you put
      it in too soon with the other metal already in, you run the risk of
      cooling the latter, &amp; so caking it,
      <a id="FNanchor_271"  href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> much as before
      referred to. Hence the very greatest care must be taken on that
      point.</p>

    <p>In Paris have I seen craftsmen cast the most wonderful things
      imaginable, and also make equally wonderful blunders. And this is
      due to the fact that technical skill
      <a id="FNanchor_272"  href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> serves you up to a
      certain point, but in some accident, for instance, you need the
      deeper knowledge of the principles of the art that leaves technical
      skill on one side, as I have evidenced to you above.</p>

    <p>Indeed I may add that I have seen 100,000 lbs. of metal cast at one
      time with so much ease that I marvelled at it, so great was the
      technical skill with which it was done; at another time I saw a
      little error made that might easily have been remedied. I stood
      &amp; watched whether they knew how to put it right, and I saw them
      throw it up, work and all, and so lose hundreds of scudi. Willingly
      would I have shown them what the remedy
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span> was, but their
      presumption was so huge that had they not known how to put my remedy
      into practice, they would have been quite capable of saying that I
      myself was the cause of all the ruin. So I stood mum and grew wise
      at their cost.</p>

    <p>Gentle reader, let that suffice about furnaces and bronze casting,
      and let us now turn to other branches of the art.</p>

        IN MARBLE OR OTHER STONES.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">There are many kinds of white marble, &amp; since
      those of Greece are the most desired,
      <a id="FNanchor_273"  href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> and the loveliest,
      let us consider them first.  And well may I speak, for I spent some
      twenty years in the wondrous city of Rome, and while there, though I
      gave my attention to the craft of the goldsmith, I always had a
      desire to do some great works in marble; &amp; I worked along of
      some of the first sculptors that lived in those days; and among them
      that I knew best was our great Michaelangelo <ins class="corr" id="Buonaroti"
      title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: Buonarotti">Buonaroti</ins>, the
      Florentine, the man that wrought better in marble than any other
      ever known. Of the reason of this I shall duly speak to you in its
      place.</p>

    <p>Let us tell, then, in the same way as we did before in other
      matters, of the qualities of marbles. I have seen five or more
      different sorts of marble.  The first of these has a very coarse
      grain,<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274"
      class="fnanchor">[274]</a> and in the grain appear certain bright
      points running close along side of each other. This marble is the
      most difficult of all to work, because it is the hardest; it is
      particularly difficult to fashion the more delicate forms in it
      without the chisel damaging or cracking them; if you do manage,
      though after much effort, to bring them off in this stone, they look
      lovely. I have found that the grain gradually softens through the
      five different sorts above-mentioned, &amp; the softest of all I
      have found verging in colour to a delicate flesh tint rather than a
      white. This sort is the most cohesive, the most beautiful and the
      tenderest marble in the world to work in.</p>

        CARRARA MARBLES.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">These marbles are again of several different
      sorts. Some are coarse-grained with plenty of
      stains,<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275"
      class="fnanchor">[275]</a> and spotted with black; these are very
      difficult to work in because the particular kind of stains they have
      in them eats into the workman’s chisels. ’Tis bad luck to him if he
      happens on one of such stained blocks; for many times they deceive
      you with a lovely surface outside, while within are all these blots.
      At Carrara and in the mountains round are many different quarries,
      and here our great Michaelangelo came himself and spent much time
      and labour in choosing the quarry from which came all the great
      statues of his hand in the sacristy of St. Lorenzo, that he made for
      Pope Clement. Let us discuss this marble a bit.</p>

    <p>Just as I kept my promise in dealing with the other branches of the
      art, of illustrating from my own notable works, so will I do
      likewise with this most noble art of sculpture. Indeed I have always
      held it to be most wondrous and beautiful, and, what is more, a good
      deal easier than any of the others; and so I decided to set my hand
      to a piece of work such as no man before had ever done. The work in
      question was the Crucified in marble.  I fashioned Him in life size,
      of noble proportions, &amp; set him upon a cross of black marble;
      this likewise was of Carrara, &amp; is a very difficult marble to
      work by reason of its being so hard and brittle.</p>

    <p>I destined this work for a tomb for myself; and I comforted myself
      with the reflection that even if the work didn’t quite succeed, at
      least the intention was good; but so great was the determination
      that I put into the work, that what with all my previous careful
      studies, I overcame all the difficulties, and satisfied
      everybody. So, though of course
      <a id="FNanchor_276"  href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a> I have done lots of
      other works of this kind, I may content myself with instancing this
      one alone in illustration of marble.</p>

    <p>To succeed with a figure in marble the art requires a good
      craftsman first to set up a little model about two palms high, and
      in this model he carefully thinks out the pose, making his figure
      draped or nude as the case may be. After this he makes a second
      model of the size his marble is to be; &amp; if he wants it to <ins class="corr" 
      id="hebe" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: he">be</ins>
      particularly good he must finish the large
      <span class="pagenum"  id="Page_136">[136]</span>model much more carefully than the small
      one. If, however, he be pressed for time, or if it be the will of
      his patron who needs the work in a hurry, it will suffice if he
      complete his big model in the manner of a good sketch, for this may
      be quickly done, whereas the working out in marble takes a long
      time. True it is that many strong men have gone straight for the
      marble with all the fury of the chisel, preferring to work merely
      from a small and well designed model, but, notwithstanding, they
      have been less satisfied with their final piece than they would have
      been in working from a full size model. This was noticeable in the
      case of our Donatello, who was a very great man, and even with the
      wondrous Michaelangelo, who worked in both ways. But it is perfectly
      well known that when his fine genius felt the insufficiency of small
      models, he set to work with the greatest humbleness to make models
      of the size of his marble; and this have we seen with our own eyes
      in the Sacristy of St. Lorenzo. When you are satisfied with your
      model you draw the principal views of your statue on to the stone,
      and mind it be well drawn, for if not you may miscut your block. The
      best method I ever saw was the one that Michaelangelo used; when you
      have drawn on your principal view you begin to chisel it round as if
      you wanted to work a half relief, and thus gradually it comes to be
      cut out. The best chisels for doing this are those that have got, I
      might say, very fine points, but the handles of which are at least
      as small as the little finger.  With this
      chisel, <i lang="it">subbia</i>, you approach to within at least
      half a finger of what is called the <i lang="it">penultima
        pelle</i>, the last skin but one; then you take a
      chisel, <i lang="it">scarpello</i>, with a notch in the middle of
      it,<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277"
      class="fnanchor">[277]</a> and carry on the work further till it be
      ready for the file, <i lang="it">lima</i>, &amp; this file again is
      called the <i lang="it">lima raspa</i>, or roughing file, or
      occasionally <i lang="it">scuffina</i>. There are ever so many sorts
      of this tool; there is the blade-shaped file, the semi-circular
      file, and others of varying sizes, five or six of them, from such as
      are two fingers thick to such as are the thickness of a very slender
      penholder. Stone borers, <i lang="it">trapani</i>, too, may be
      employed wherever you have to undercut any difficult piece of
      drapery, or any pose of the figure that stands free. These borers
      are of two kinds, one that you turn by means of a thong and a handle
      with a hole through it; with this you can do all the more delicate
      and minute interstices in hair or drapery; the other is larger and
      called the <i lang="it">trapano apetto</i>, which you use in those
      parts for which the first is inapplicable.</p>

    <p>When the chisels, whether <i lang="it">subbie</i>
      or <i lang="it">scarpelli</i>, the files, and the borers have all
      done their work to the due completing of your figure, you proceed to
      polish the surface with a fine white, close-grained pumice stone. I
      must not omit to say for the guidance of those who are unskilled in
      working marble, that they may strike boldly in with
      their <i lang="it">subbie</i>; for the more
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span> delicate
      <i lang="it">subbia</i>, provided it be not inserted straight into
      the stone, does not crack the marble, but just chips off as lightly
      as possible whatever may be necessary; while with
      the <i lang="it">scarpello a tacca</i> the rough edges may then be
      brought to an even plane, &amp; you go over the work with it just as
      if you were making a drawing for the surface. And this truly is the
      right method, and the one which the great Michaelangelo
      employed. Some have tried other ways, and thinking to have their
      work done quicker have sought to get their figure out by taking a
      bit off first in one place and then in another, but it took them all
      the longer in the end, and wasn’t near so good; and indeed they
      mightily mistook, for oftentimes they had to piece up their figures,
      and yet with all their patching and piecing they could not remedy
      the mistakes which a want of discipline<a id="FNanchor_278"
      href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> and patience at the
      outset had led them into.</p>

    <p>Gladly would I go on to describe the various kinds
      of <i lang="it">subbie</i>, <i lang="it">scarpelli</i>, and
      <i lang="it">trapani</i>, and likewise the mallets, all of which are
      of iron tempered, or of the very finest steel; but as everybody in
      Italy, nowadays, knows all about these things it really isn’t
      necessary. Had I been writing in France I should have described
      another sort of stone which is very soft to work in, &amp; also
      white, but not the brilliant white of marble, rather a dull
      white. This stone, after it is first quarried, is so soft and easy
      to work, that some masters, especially those of Paris, and I too,
      while there, wrought it with wooden chisels, only we notched them in
      various ways in order the easier to cut the work out according to
      the sketch. After this it was finished with delicate and close
      chisels, pointed tools<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279"
      class="fnanchor">[279]</a> and <i lang="it">scarpelli</i> of all
      sorts. This stone, in course of time, hardened almost like marble,
      especially its external surface, but I never saw any that came up to
      marble when it was cleaned.</p>

    <p>The ancients, you know, had so great a joy in things of this kind
      that they paid their sculptors with fine liberality, and so they
      came to investigate the most difficult things; amongst others they
      wrought in a sort of green stone, often nowadays called Greek stone,
      of the hardness of agate or <ins class="corr" id="chalcedony"
      title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: calcedony">chalcedony</ins>.
      Now though I have seen fair
      sized figures in this stone, I have never been able to imagine how
      it was worked, for, though it admits of being smoothed with
      lead<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280"
      class="fnanchor">[280]</a> and emery for the purpose of pavements
      and such things, I can only conceive that for carving figures out of
      it the ancient masters must have had some secret of tempering their
      steel, and so were enabled to overcome the stone’s tremendous
      hardness.</p>

    <p>There are yet other kinds of stone of which I have in Rome seen
      statues, both many and great, serpentine and porphyry, but more of
      porphyry,
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span> for the stone is
      somewhat softer. Up to our own day there was no one who worked in
      this stone, till one of our Fiesolé carvers took it up, his name was
      Francesco del Tadda. This man with a fine cunning found out the way
      of working in porphyry. His patience was great, &amp; he used little
      hammers, <i lang="it">martelleti</i>, sharpened like
      chisels, <i lang="it">subbie</i>, and
      other <i lang="it">scarpelletti</i>, which he tempered by a special
      process of his own.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281"
      class="fnanchor">[281]</a> Francesco made Porphyry busts just as
      fine as the ancients. Had he been equally strong in designing he
      might have done over life size work too, but let it suffice that he
      has the credit of being the first among moderns to practise this
      art.  Would that his example might inspire all who have great work
      at heart, princely patrons as well as artists!</p>

    <p>We have yet another kind of stone which is called granite. It is
      somewhat softer than porphyry and there are two kinds, the one is
      red and comes from the East, the other is white or black &amp; comes
      from the quarries at Elba; it is very hard to work. The column of
      Santa Trinita that came to Florence from Rome is of this
      sort. Moreover it is durable and beautiful, but no statues have been
      made from this stone in our time.</p>

    <p>There are still some other stones that must not be passed over,
      stones that we get from near Florence, Fiesolé, Settignano and other
      places. Of these, there is one of a blue colour, very delicate,
      &amp; as charming to work in as to look at, the country folk call
      it <i lang="it">pietra serena</i>. Great columns are made of it,
      because it is found in large masses in the quarry, statues are made
      of it too; but it is no good for open-air use, for though it is
      beautiful it has no durability. Another sort &amp; a veritable
      quarry stone<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282"
      class="fnanchor">[282]</a> is the tan-coloured.  It is soft to work
      in, statues are made of it, and it is so durable that it will resist
      all effects of wind and weather. Yet another sort, and this likewise
      a tan-coloured variety, is called the <i lang="it">pietra forte</i>,
      the ‘strong stone,’ &amp; strong it is indeed, for it is desperately
      hard to work in, statues, weapons, masks, &amp; many other things
      are made of it. You cannot, however, quarry it in very great pieces
      as you can the Fiesolé or Settignano varieties. I have mentioned
      these three sorts of stone because statues may be made in
      them. There are many others in and around Florence, beautifully
      marked stones, some hard, some soft, but as they are not used for
      figure work, I shall have no more to say about them.</p>

        DISQUISITION ON COLOSSAL STATUES, WHETHER MODERATELY OR VERY
        GREAT.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">Most gracious of readers, forasmuch as I have
      always promised to illustrate my words with instances from my own
      created works, I would like now to tell you of another branch of the
      subject, and one that is both the most difficult and the most
      admirable of any so far described; allow me then to make the
      following digression, so that those who read may have means of
      pondering it well. I mean colossi; not necessarily the very great
      ones, because whenever a statue is three times bigger than life size
      it may be termed a colossus. I have seen plenty of such, both
      ancient and modern. But of the very great ones I have only seen one,
      and that was in Rome; it was in many pieces, &amp; I saw the head,
      feet, part of the legs and other fragments of its great limbs. Upon
      measuring the head, which was standing upright and without the neck,
      I found as I stood alongside it that it came up to my nipples, so
      that it would measure more than two &amp; a half Florentine cubits,
      the complete statue therefore must have been about twenty cubits
      high.</p>

    <p>When I served the great King Francis,—it must have been about the
      year 1540,—knowing his consummate taste and his delight in
      everything rare and masterful, knowing, too, that such an object had
      never yet been fashioned by any living artist, I made among the
      other works before-mentioned a model for a fountain at
      Fontainebleau, or as one might translate it ‘<i lang="it">Fontana
        Belio</i>,’ ‘the fountain of fine waters.’ This model was square in
      form, and in the middle of the square was a square base rising four
      cubits above the water. It was richly ornamented with many pleasing
      designs, and devices appropriate to the King and to the
      fountain. Upon the base was a figure representing the God Mars, and
      at the four corners were figures having reference all of them to his
      Majesty.  When I showed it to the King it was to a smaller scale,
      but in its full size the central figure would have been forty cubits
      high, the side figures being proportionately smaller. When the King
      saw the model he examined it a long while with the greatest
      satisfaction, and then asked me of the central figure. It was a God
      of War, I said, and hence most appropriate to his Majesty. Then he
      asked me of the other figures. They represented, I said, the four
      virtues in which he especially delighted. Just as the
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span> central figure
      betokened the glory of arms, so did this one at the corner represent
      the glory of letters; this one again sculpture, painting, and
      architecture; the next music and every sort of musical harmony;
      while the last personified liberality, the cause, mainspring &amp;
      foster-mother of all the other virtues, and one that was most
      abundant in his Majesty. His Majesty promptly gave me the commission
      to proceed with the work, which I did, inspired by his delightful
      encouragement and with abundance of all sorts of things placed at my
      service. After the careful completion of my little model, as it did
      not seem to me possible to retain all the proper proportions if I
      worked direct from it into the full size, I determined to make
      another model three times the size of the small one,—about the
      stature of a well-formed man therefore. This model I made in gesso,
      so that it should the better resist the much handling that is
      inevitable from frequent measuring. After setting up the iron
      skeleton I covered it with gesso, and finished it beautifully,
      putting more care and detail into it than the little one.</p>

    <p>I would take this opportunity, gentle reader, of bidding you bear
      in mind that all the really great masters have followed life, but
      the point is that you must have a fine judgment to know how the best
      of life is to be put into your work, you must always be on the look
      out for beautiful human beings, and from among them choose the most
      beautiful, &amp; not only so, you must from among even these choose
      the most beautiful parts, and so shall your whole composition become
      an abstraction of what is beautiful.  So alone may work be created,
      that shall be evident at once as the labour of men both exquisite in
      judgment and humble in study. Such men are rare! Now such zeal had
      I, and so many conveniences were placed at my service by that most
      liberal King Francis, that I brought this three-sized model of mine
      to completion; not only was I satisfied with it myself, but it
      pleased everybody who knew what good work was. Truly great Art is
      infinite, &amp; the more study you put into your work the easier it
      is for you to see its blemishes than others, but for all that it is
      sometimes good to cry ‘hold, enough!’ even to one’s own work, so
      meseemed here I ought to content me, and therefore I arranged for
      setting my work up in due order from
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span> the scale model to
      the final forty cubits. This was how I went about it.</p>


    <hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop">

    <div class="chapter">
      <h3 id="CHAPTER_VIII_THE_MYSTERY">CHAPTER VIII. THE
        MYSTERY OF MAKING GREAT COLOSSI.</h3>
    </div>


    <p class="drop-capx">To begin with, then, I divided the model, which
      was to be translated from three cubits to forty, into forty small
      parts, each of these parts again I divided into twenty-four
      parts. But as I knew that this method alone would not suffice to
      arrive at the requisite size, I devised another method, a method
      entirely my own, never invented by anyone before, &amp; the outcome
      of my own great researches. As I am always generously inclined, I
      will impart it to such as have good work at heart.  It is this: I
      took four square pieces of wood measuring respectively three fingers
      each way, they were very straight, and planed nice and smooth, and
      they were exactly the height of my figure. These I fixed into the
      ground, plumbing them absolutely straight, and at such distance from
      the figure as to admit of a man entering in between; they were then
      match-boarded<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283"
      class="fnanchor">[283]</a> all round, the boards being likewise
      perfectly straight, &amp; a small opening at the back to enter
      by. Up against this match-boarding I began making my measurements,
      &amp; then I drew out on the floor of a long room a
      profile<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284"
      class="fnanchor">[284]</a> of the whole statue, forty cubits in
      size. Finding this plan work out with delightful accuracy, I
      proceeded next to make a skeleton three cubits high, similar to that
      of the model. This skeleton was all joined together with pieces of
      wood, fastened respectively to a very straight rod, the latter
      served for the left leg, upon which my figure rested. I took the
      measurements of the body of the figure off the case, making
      allowance in doing so for the thickness of the flesh and bone work
      it had subsequently to be clothed with. Thereupon I erected a great
      mast forty cubits high in the centre of the court of my castle, and
      round it I set up four other masts just as I had done it with the
      model, and these also I cased round with match-boarding just as I
      had done the small model. Then I joined together the life size
      skeleton, taking the measurements exactly from the small skeleton,
      for every little piece a large piece, and so marking off every
      measurement of every part of my figure proportionately from one case
      on to the other.</p>

    <p>Had I scaled the work off in the usual way I should have had no end
      of difficulties, but this method of mine with the cases avoided all
      that, and I got as fine a proportion in my life size as in my small
      figures. Now as my figure was posed upon the left foot, and had the
      right foot resting on a helmet, I so arranged the skeleton as to
      make it possible to get inside the
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span> helmet &amp; climb
      easily through the foot right up into the head. The skeleton
      completed, I clothed it in flesh, that is to say in gesso, and laid
      it on rapidly in the same manner. When I had got the work completed
      to the last skin but one, I had the front of the casing opened, and
      stepped back to view it some forty cubits, which was as much as
      there was room for in my court-yard. Everybody was delighted with
      the result, not only connoisseurs, many of whom came to see, but,
      what was much more important, I myself, who had given so much labour
      towards its fulfilment. What pleased me most, however, was the fact
      that there was not the slightest discrepancy between the small and
      the large model. By this method of mine I set working a number of
      labourers &amp; people unskilled in the profession, it wasn’t in the
      least necessary for them to know what they were doing. Indeed so
      masterly is my invention that nothing but patience and diligence are
      needed, for the rest you may be a perfect ignoramus in the art, and
      not even the hand of a Michaelangelo help you. In a colossus of this
      kind the masses of muscle, &amp;c., are so huge that it is
      impossible to take them in from the ordinary point of vision, which
      one may put at twice the length of a man; &amp; if you approach the
      figure at arm’s length in order to work it you see nothing; if, on
      the other hand, you go a long way off you do see a little more, but
      still not enough to remedy the great errors that must arise. You
      see, therefore, that without this method of mine it is impossible to
      carry out a large colossus with fine proportions. Truly, many a
      statue of ten cubits high has been spoilt by some blunder or other;
      and I really think that not even statues of six cubits high can be
      properly made without this method of mine. Of course it is quite
      conceivable that just as I have discovered this method so some
      greater genius than I may discover a better one still; but then it’s
      always easy to improve a patent!</p>

    <p>When the King came to Paris, he lay, as was his wont, at his
      castle, the Logro (the Louvre); it was opposite my castle of Little
      Nello, for there was only the Seine in between. I crossed the river
      and waited upon his Majesty. He was quite charming to me, and asked
      me if I had anything lovely to show him. I replied that as for the
      loveliness I wasn’t so sure, but I had done some work with great
      study and with all the devotion that so noble an art demanded, and
      that if it was good it was due to him who allowed me to want for
      nothing, such freehandedness being the only way of getting the best
      work done. To this the King yeasaid me, and the day following he
      came to my house. After I had shown him a variety of different work
      I made him enter the court-yard, placing him at the point whence my
      great statue told to the best advantage. He obeyed me with
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span> the greatest
      condescension and the most perfect breeding;
      <a id="FNanchor_285"  href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> and, indeed, never
      have I met any prince who had such a wonderful way with him.  Now
      while I was conversing with his Majesty I ordered Ascanio, my pupil,
      to let the curtain down. Instantly the King raised his hands &amp;
      spoke in my praise the most complimentary words that human tongue
      ever uttered. After which, turning to Monsignor
      d’Aniballe,<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286"
      class="fnanchor">[286]</a> ‘I command you,’ he said, most
      emphatically, ‘to give the first good fat Abbey that falls vacant to
      our Benvenuto, for I do not want my kingdom to be deprived of his
      like.’ At this I bowed deeply and thanked the King, while he, well
      satisfied, went back to his castle.</p>

    <p>Now knew I what pleasure my labour caused this great King,
      encouragement brought encouragement, and I set to yet greater
      labours still. I took 30 lbs. of silver of my own money &amp; gave
      it to two of my workmen, with the designs and the models to make two
      large vases of. As it was a time of great wars I had asked no money
      of the King, and also left untouched six months of my
      salary. Setting to work lustily at my own vases, I finished them in
      a month’s time, and set out with them to find the King who was in a
      city by the sea called Argentana. When I gave him the vases he was
      most engaging, &amp; said: ‘Be of good heart, my Benvenuto, for I am
      one that both can &amp; will reward your labours better than anyone
      else in the world.’ To which I replied that from earliest
      recollections my mightiest labours had been the discovery &amp;
      application of my method relating to the founding of great colossi;
      that now, thanks to God, my model had come up to my expectations,
      that the casting had now to be considered, and that this would have
      to be done in over one hundred separate pieces, fitted together with
      swallow-tail joints. Nor would it be very difficult for us to do, as
      I had already devised a skeleton of iron upon which to attach the
      various portions of the colossus as I cast them, commencing at the
      feet and piece by piece fitting them together up to the head. The
      only difficulty would be the putting together of the iron skeleton;
      but this, too, I would take credit for surmounting, observing the
      same process as I had carried out previously in the wooden one. It
      would be necessary, then, for me to fix the first rods of the
      skeleton straightway into their final position, that is to say, at
      his Majesty’s residence at Fontainebleau, where I should have to be
      provided with a room sufficiently large for the purpose. To this the
      King replied that, if there were no other rooms suitable to my
      purpose, he would give up to me his own private apartment, so great
      was his desire to see a work of this kind finished. I might take
      courage, then, and be of a light heart, and, he added, I might
      return to Paris to this end. The two big vases were standing on the
      table before his Majesty, &amp; as he was
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span> fingering and
      praising them, I preferred the request to him that, as the time was
      opportune, it being the time of war, he would grant me permission to
      return for four months to Italy, to revisit my fatherland, my
      relatives &amp; friends. At these words of mine his Majesty grew
      very sour of aspect, and turned to me, saying, ‘I wish you to gild
      these two vases from top to bottom with dull gilding!’ This remark
      he repeated twice, and then rose quickly from the table and said
      nothing further. By ‘dull’ I fancied he meant two things: firstly,
      that I was a ‘dull fool’ to ask such a liberty; &amp; secondly, that
      the gold on the vases was to be left unburnished. When his Majesty
      had withdrawn I begged the Cardinal of Ferrara, to whom was
      entrusted the duty of looking after me, to procure the leave for
      me. The Cardinal bade me go back to Paris, and that he would let me
      know what I should do. In the space of a fortnight he sent word by
      one of his servants that I could go, but that I should return as
      soon as possible. I praised God and set out.</p>

    <p>Of the property in my castle I took absolutely nothing with me,
      neither the stuffs nor the house furniture, the silver nor the gold,
      nor the embossed vases, nor any of the other works made
      independently of the agreements entered into with the King, works
      all of them carried out by my workmen and paid for by me. The great
      works enumerated in this book, and made for the King, his Majesty
      had himself valued at over 16,000 scudi.  I not unnaturally thought
      that, as I had not only taken nothing, but was likewise a creditor
      for so large a treasure, I should come back quick enough.</p>

    <p>So I came to Italy and reached Florence my native city, &amp; went
      to Poggio in Caiano, and shook hands with the grand Duke Cosimo, and
      he received me very charmingly. Two days after, the grand Duke gave
      me an order to make a small model for a Perseus, which was most
      gratifying to me, &amp; two months sufficed to do it in. When his
      Excellency saw it he was beyond measure pleased, &amp; he said to me
      in the presence of a number of gentlemen: ‘Had you the courage to
      carry out the work as finely in a great piece as here in your little
      model, it would be the grandest work on the Piazza.’ To these
      gratifying words I replied: ‘My lord, in the Piazza are works by
      Donatello and the great Michaelangelo, both of them men that in the
      glory of their works have beaten the ancients; as for me
      I <em>have</em> the courage to execute this work to the size of five
      cubits, and in so doing make it ever so much better than the model.’
      At this there was no end of argumentation.</p>

    <p>Now, as the war was still raging hotly in France, I thought I
      should have
      <span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span> plenty of time to
      cast one at least of the two figures.<a id="FNanchor_287"
      href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> But when they heard
      in France that I was working in Florence for the grand Duke Cosimo,
      his Majesty took it very ill indeed, and he said on several
      occasions: ‘Didn’t I tell Benvenuto that he was a dull fool?’ Upon
      which the Cardinal of Ferrara did me a bad turn and made matters
      worse, so that in the end the King said he would never call me back
      again. All this was notified to me in writing on behalf of the
      King. To this I replied that what alone troubled me was leaving so
      great a work unfinished, but that I should never think of going
      anywhere where I wasn’t called. And so it came about that what with
      the encouragement of his Excellency I set to work to get my Perseus
      through. After some time, it must have been several months, the King
      relented, and, discussing the matter with the Cardinal of Ferrara,
      said to him that it had been a great mistake ever to have let me
      go. The Cardinal replied that it needed but a wink to fetch me back
      again. To this the King said that it was the Cardinal’s duty to have
      prevented it; &amp; instantly turning to one of his treasurers, by
      name Giuliano Buonaccorsi, one of our Florentines, said to him:
      ‘Send Benvenuto 6,000 scudi, &amp; tell him to come back and finish
      his great colossus, and I’ll make it up with him.’ The treasurer
      wrote to me all about his Majesty’s making it up, but he didn’t send
      any coin, saying, however, that upon hearing my reply he would at
      once give the order for the money. To this I, on my part, replied
      that I was quite ready &amp; would make it up too. In the midst of
      these negotiations to and fro, the good King departed this life;
      thus was I deprived of the glory of my great work, the reward of all
      my labours, and of everything that I had left behind me. So I set to
      work to finish my Perseus.</p>

        <br>
        Illustrations in this eBook have been positioned between
        paragraphs and outside quotations. In versions of this eBook that
        support hyperlinks, the page references in the List of
        Illustrations lead to the corresponding illustrations.<br>
        <br>
        Titles from the List of Illustrations and List of Diagrams have been
        applied to the images as captions. The second jewellery illustration
        has a new caption, as the one from the index would be confusing out
        of context. Illustrations that did not have a title have had a
        descriptive caption added, these are indicated with parentheses.<br>
        <br>
        Obvious typographical errors and punctuation errors have been
        corrected after careful comparison with other occurrences within
        the text and consultation of external sources.<br>
        <br>
        Some hyphens in words have been silently removed, some added, when
        a predominant preference was found in the original book.<br><br>
        Errata listed on page 167 have been applied to the text.  Except
        for those changes noted below, all misspellings in the text, and
